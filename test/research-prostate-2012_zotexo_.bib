	annote = {PURPOSE: Obesity has been implicated in the etiology of benign and malignant prostatic growth due to its influence on metabolic and endocrine changes. Because obesity is an important determinant of serum levels of insulin and leptin (the product of the obesity gene Ob), we investigated the role of obesity and serum levels of insulin and leptin in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fasting serum levels of insulin and leptin as well as the body mass index, a measure of overall obesity, and waist-to-hip ratio, an indicator of abdominal obesity, were determined in 200 men newly diagnosed with BPH who were hospitalized for surgery and in 302 randomly selected healthy male subjects from the population in Shanghai, China. RESULTS: A higher waist-to-hip ratio and higher serum insulin were significantly associated with an increased risk of BPH. Relative to men in the lowest waist-to-hip ratio quartile (less than 0.856) those in the highest quartile (greater than 0.923) were at 2.4-fold risk (odds ratio 2.42, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.34 to 4.37, test for trend p = 0.01). Similarly relative to men in the lowest quartile of insulin (less than 5.87 microU. per ml.) those in the highest quartile (greater than 9.76 microU. per ml.) were at significantly increased risk (odds ratio 2.47, 95\% CI 1.35 to 4.54, test for trend p = 0.009). The effect of insulin on BPH risk was more pronounced in men in low and middle tertiles of the waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratios comparing high to low insulin tertiles 2.8 and 2.7, respectively), while among men in the highest waist-to-hip ratio tertile insulin was not significantly associated with BPH risk. In contrast, we found no significant odds ratio comparing the highest to lowest quartiles of leptin (odds ratio 0.62, 95\% CI 0.33 to 1.17) or body mass index (odds ratio 1.64, 95\% CI 0.96 to 2.81). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that abdominal obesity and increasing serum insulin, and possibly overall obesity but not serum leptin are associated with a higher risk of BPH. Further prospective and laboratory studies are needed to confirm these results and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.}

To determine if variants in circadian genes alter prostate cancer risk, we genotyped five variants in five circadian genes in a population-based case-control study conducted in China (187 cases and 242 controls). These variants included CRY2 rs1401417:G{\textgreater}C, CSNK1E rs1005473:A{\textgreater}C, NPAS2 rs2305160:G{\textgreater}A, PER1 rs2585405:G{\textgreater}C and PER3 54-bp repeat length variant. Men with the cryptochrome 2 (CRY2)-variant C allele had a significant 1.7-fold increased prostate cancer risk (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.7) relative to those with the GG genotype. This risk increased to 4.1-fold (95\% CI, 2.2-8.0) in men who also had greater insulin resistance (IR) as compared to men with the GG genotype and less IR. In contrast, among men with less IR, the NPAS2-variant A allele was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk (odds ratio=0.5, 95\% CI, 0.3-1.0) as compared to the GG genotype. Our findings, although in need of confirmation, suggest that variations in circadian genes may alter prostate cancer risk and some biological processes may modify this effect.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases advance online publication, 6 November 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.pcan.4501024.}

To avoid unnecessary treatment, tools are needed to identify the small proportion of patients who are destined to develop lethal prostate cancer. METHODS: To evaluate the accuracy of early changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as predictors of prostate cancer outcome, we assessed serial measurements of PSA level among 267 men with localized prostate cancer in a Scandinavian cohort of men who were diagnosed between 1989 and 1999 and who were managed by watchful waiting. We then 1) fitted individual regression lines to the PSA values assessed for each patient during the first 2 years of follow-up by using three different models, 2) evaluated early PSA curve characteristics as determinants of the cumulative incidence of lethal prostate cancer and calculated hazard ratios for baseline PSA value and rate of change in PSA level to prostate cancer outcome, and 3) plotted time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: During complete follow-up for a mean of 8.5 years, 34 patients (13\%) died from prostate cancer, and 18 (7\%) developed metastases but were still alive at end of follow-up. In a log-linear model, both PSA value at baseline (P = .05) and the rate of PSA change (P{\textless}.001) were associated with the development of lethal prostate cancer. In the ROC analysis, however, the accuracy of classifying the disease as either indolent or destined to progress was low, regardless of the cut point chosen for initial PSA level or rate of change in PSA level. CONCLUSIONS: Although baseline PSA value and rate of PSA change are prognostic factors for lethal prostate cancer, they are poor predictors of lethal prostate cancer among patients with localized prostate cancer who are managed by watchful waiting.},

Rather, investigators tend to rely on intuition to comment qualitatively on how misclassification might impact their findings. We point out several ways in which intuition might fail, in the context of unmatched case-control analysis with non-differential exposure misclassification. Particularly, we focus on how intuition can conflict with the results of a Bayesian analysis that accounts for the various uncertainties at hand. First, the Bayesian adjustment for misclassification can weaken the evidence about the direction of an exposure-disease association. Second, admitting uncertainty about the misclassification parameters can lead to narrower interval estimates concerning the association. We focus on the simple setting of unmatched case-control analysis with binary exposure and without adjustment for confounders, though much of our discussion should be relevant more generally.}

Creation of model by using extrapolated linear regression slopes of CD4 count to predict development of AIDS after 1993. SETTING--Regional haemophilia centre in teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--111 men with haemophilia infected with HIV during 1979-85. Median length of follow up 10.1 years, median number of CD4 counts 17. The model was not fitted for three men because only one CD4 measurement was available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of AIDS. INTERVENTIONS--From 1989 prophylaxis against candida and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and antiretroviral drugs when CD4 count fell below 200 x 10(6)/l. RESULTS--44 men developed AIDS up to 1 January 1993. When AIDS was defined as a CD4 count of 50 x 10(6)/l the model predicted that 25\% (95\% confidence interval 16\% to 34\%) would survive for 20 years after seroconversion and 18\% (11\% to 25\%) for 25 years.

DESIGN: Analyses were based on national surveillance data. METHODS: Back-projection analyses based on quarterly AIDS counts to the end of 1994 were used to estimate the numbers of AIDS diagnoses which would have occurred if new treatments had not reduced the rate of progression to AIDS. Estimates of the reduction in AIDS diagnoses between 1995 and 1998 were made by subtracting the observed delay-adjusted AIDS counts from the predicted AIDS incidence. RESULTS: AIDS incidence between 1995 and 1998 was estimated to have been reduced by 1093 cases (33\%) following the availability of new antiretroviral treatments (95\% confidence interval 831 (25\%) to 1425 (43\%) cases). The majority of this reduction in AIDS incidence was estimated to have occurred during 1997 (434 cases) and 1998 (427 cases). CONCLUSIONS: AIDS incidence in Australia has declined since 1995 coincidental with introduction of new antiretroviral treatments. In particular, the more rapid decline in AIDS incidence since mid-1996 coincided with the availability and widespread uptake of combinations including protease inhibitors},

DESIGN: Case-control study nested in longitudinal cohort.
SETTING: Västerbotten Intervention Project cohort, Umeå, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: 540 cases and 1034 controls matched for age and date of blood draw.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Validity of prostate specific antigen for prediction of subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis by record linkage to cancer registry.
RESULTS: Blood samples were drawn on average 7.1 (SD 3.7) years before diagnosis. The area under the curve for prostate specific antigen was 0.84 (95\% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.86). At prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml, sensitivity estimates were 59\%, 44\%, and 33\%, and specificity estimates were 87\%, 92\%, and 95\%. The positive likelihood ratio commonly considered to "rule in disease" is 10; in this study the positive likelihood ratios were 4.5, 5.5, and 6.4 for prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml. The negative likelihood ratio commonly considered to "rule out disease" is 0.1; in this study the negative likelihood ratios were 0.47, 0.61, and 0.70 for prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml. For a cut-off of 1.0 ng/ml, the negative likelihood ratio was 0.08.
CONCLUSIONS: No single cut-off value for prostate specific antigen concentration attained likelihood ratios formally required for a screening test. Prostate specific antigen concentrations below 1.0 ng/ml virtually ruled out a prostate cancer diagnosis during the follow-up. Additional biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer are needed before population based screening for prostate cancer should be introduced.},

However, the proportion of cancer patients with known previous cancer depends on the time cancer registries have been running, which results in varying proportions of excluded patients across registries. If prognosis of patients with second cancers differs from prognosis of patients with first cancers, varying exclusions may bias survival comparisons. We empirically evaluate the dependence of proportions of patients recorded as having a first cancer on time since initiation of cancer registration and the impact of excluding patients with known previous cancer on cancer survival estimates using the data of the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. Among 20 common cancer sites investigated, the proportion of "first cancers" varied between 97.4 and 99.7\% in 1953-1957, the first 5-years of cancer registration, and decreased continuously to levels between 83.9 and 92.7\% in 1993-1997. Excluding patients with a previous cancer diagnosis had little impact on estimates of survival of cancer patients diagnosed in 1953-1957, but increased 5-year relative survival estimates among patients diagnosed in 1993-1997 for each of the 20 cancers. The extent of the increase varied by cancer site and age. The increase ranged up to 2.9\% points for crude and up to 1.7\% points for age adjusted 5-year relative survival. These results caution against exclusion of patients with previous cancer diagnosis in comparative analyses of cancer survival.}

However, the correlation may in fact be heterogeneous and depend on cluster characteristics. Accurate modeling of the correlation has the potential to improve inference. We use second-order generalized estimating equations to model heterogeneous correlation in cluster-randomized trials. Using simulation studies we show that accurate modeling of heterogeneous correlation can improve inference when the correlation is high or varies by cluster size. We apply the methods to a cluster-randomized trial of an intervention to promote breast cancer screening.}

We examine this setting further, giving theoretical and empirical results concerning the frequentist and Bayesian performance of random coefficient regression. Particularly, we compare estimators based on this adjustment for residual confounding to estimators based on the assumption of no residual confounding. This devolves to comparing an estimator from a nonidentified but more realistic model to an estimator from a less realistic but identified model. The approach described by Gustafson (2005, Statistical Science 20, 111-140) is used to quantify the performance of a Bayesian estimator arising from a nonidentified model. From both theoretical calculations and simulations we find support for the idea that superior performance can be obtained by replacing unrealistic identifying constraints with priors that allow modest departures from those constraints. In terms of point-estimator bias this superiority arises when the extent of residual confounding is substantial, but the advantage is much broader in terms of interval estimation. The benefit from modeling residual confounding is maintained when the prior distributions employed only roughly correspond to reality, for the standard identifying constraints are equivalent to priors that typically correspond much worse.}

Annual mesothelioma deaths now account for {\textgreater}1\% of all cancer deaths. A Poisson regression model based on a previous work by Hodgson et al has been fitted, which has allowed informed statistical inferences about model parameters and predictions of future mesothelioma mortality to be made. METHODS: In the Poisson regression model, the mesothelioma risk of an individual depends on the average collective asbestos dose for the individual in a given year and an age-specific exposure potential. The model has been fitted to the data within a Bayesian framework using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, providing credible intervals for model parameters as well as prediction intervals for the number of future cases of mortality. RESULTS: Males were most likely to have been exposed to asbestos between the ages of 30 and 49 years, with the peak year of asbestos exposure estimated to be 1963. The estimated number of background cases was 1.08 cases per million population. CONCLUSION: Mortality among males is predicted to peak at approximately 2040 deaths in the year 2016, with a rapid decline thereafter. Approximately 91,000 deaths are predicted to occur from 1968 to 2050 with around 61,000 of these occurring from 2007 onwards.},

METHODS: A statistical method, MIAMOD (mortality-incidence analysis model), was used to estimate regional cancer incidence and prevalence from regional cancer mortality data and patient survival data recorded by the cancer registries. Estimates of the cancer incidence and prevalence in the various regions have thus been obtained for a number of major cancer sitas. A first and important step in validating the regional estimates has been the comparison of the MIAMOD estimates in the areas covered by the cancer registries with empirical incidence and prevalence observed by CRs, in order to assess the consistency in data, methods and assumptions. Empirical prevalence has been calculated by counting patients with a diagnosis of cancer who were alive on the reference date by PREVAL method. A correction factor has been applied to include patients diagnosed before the period of activity of the registry. RESULTS: General consistency was found between empirical and estimated (by MIAMOD) incidence and prevalence in the registry areas, which is indicative of the quality and the completeness of all data involved as well as the appropriateness of model choices. The prevalence of all cancers combined for Italian regions with CRs was estimated and projected to the year 2000 as ranging between 1,240 per 100,000 in Sicilia and 2,781 in Emilia-Romagna for men, while for women these figures were 1,765 in Sicilia and 4,019 in Liguria. Comparison of cancer prevalence in CR areas with regional estimates shows quite good consistency for Piemonte, Liguria and Lombardia, which means that the local CRs (of Torino, Genova and Varese, respectively) are representative of their respective regions. Prevalence in Emilia-Romagna appears to be rather well represented by only one, the Parma CR, of the three local CRs. The southern Italian registries of Latina and Ragusa recorded a lower cancer prevalence than was actually estimated in their respective regions. DISCUSSION: Cancer registries with a longer period of activity showed better agreement between empirical and estimated figures due to the more precise information provided, particularly regarding survival and incidence trends. In conclusion, this work shows the potential of the cancer registries not only to represent their population with respect to cancer morbidity but also as an invaluable tool to extrapolate this information to the larger areas they represent.}

Although optimality could potentially be recovered by use of a weighted log rank statistic, the optimal weights are difficult to specify a priori and the potential loss of power by use of poorly specified weights is great. We describe a likelihood ratio test with two degrees of freedom for use in this situation which is based on a fit of a weakly structured full model. Computation of an approximate significance level for this test is described and a large sample justification for this approximation is given. Size and power properties of the proposed statistic are compared to that of several other statistics in a small simulation study and the statistic is applied to data from the HIP Breast Cancer Screening Trial.}

In order to make screening worthwhile, it is necessary to find policies that minimize overdiagnosis, without significantly increasing prostate cancer mortality (PCM). Using a microsimulation model (MISCAN) we project the outcomes of 83 screening policies in the US population, with different start and stop ages, screening frequencies, strategies where the PSA value changes the screening frequency, and strategies in which the PSA threshold (PSAt) increases with age. In the basecase strategy, yearly screening 50-74 with a PSAt of 3, the lifetime risk of PCM and overdiagnosis equals, respectively, 2.4 and 3.8\%. The policies that reduce overdiagnosis the most (for maximum PCM increases relative to basecase of 1\%, 3\%, and 5\%, respectively) are with a PSAt of 3, (1) yearly screening 50-74 where, if PSA {\textless}1 at age 65 or older, frequency becomes 4 years, with 3.6\% (5.9\% reduction), (2) 2-year screening 50-72, with 2.9\% (24.3\% reduction), and (3) yearly screening 50-70 (PSAt of 4 after age 66), with 2.2\% (43.4\% reduction). Stopping screening at age 70 is a reasonable way to reduce the harms and keep the benefit. Decreasing the stopping age has a larger effect on overdiagnosis reduction than reducing the screen frequency. Screening policies where the frequency of screening depends on PSA result or in which the PSAt changes with age did not substantially improve the balance of harms and benefits relative to simple yearly screening.},

A scoring rule is proper. if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distribution F if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G 4 F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Investigation of long time series of cancer data can still be very useful in helping to identify Cancer Control priorities and achievements. Since the partition of Ireland into the independent Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, cancer mortality data have been published in an essentially similar format in both countries. The information presented here will contribute to providing a basis for the collaborative Cancer Research programme initiated recently. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer mortality data have been assembled and analysed separately for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland: the data have then been combined to present mortality rates for the whole of Ireland, covering the period from 1926 to 1995. Several rubrics had to be aggregated to provide data continuously over the time span (e.g. colon and rectum and cervix and body of the uterus). When data were only available in 10-year classes of age, the EM algorithm was employed to obtain 5-year age-specific rates. All rates presented are age-standardised, employing the World Standard Population. RESULTS: In women, the death rate from all neoplasms combined increased very slightly from 117 per 100 000 in 1946-1950 to 120 per 100 000 in 1991-1995. In men, the death rate increased from 127 per 100 000 to 172 per 100 000 over the same time period. The overall cancer death rate in Ireland is currently similar to the European average in men, although in women it is among the top fifth of national cancer mortality rates in European countries. While cancer is a major cause of death in Ireland, there is no evidence of an evolving epidemic building up: the death rates from most forms of cancer are declining towards the end of the time period considered. CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated by falling death rates from Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer, major treatment advances appear to have been incorporated effectively into clinical practice in Ireland. Progress is apparent in tobacco control and further initiatives in this area must be undertaken since tobacco appears to be the only major new carcinogen introduced recently into the Irish environment during the period covered by this study. Effective population-based screening programmes for cervix and breast cancer and, more controversially, consideration of a National Prostate Cancer Screening programme, offer scope for further improvement in mortality. Examination of this long time series of mortality data from Ireland provides information about the evolving cancer pattern and provides the necessary background to evaluate the impact of the cross-border cancer research activities now being launched.}

However, small CIN3 lesions are rarely associated with concurrent invasion. We hypothesized that aggressive follow-up for cytology of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) leads predominantly to detection of smaller CIN3 lesions than those usually associated with cancer. We assessed this hypothesis in a masked histopathologic review of 330 CIN3 lesions in the ASCUS LSILTriage Study, focusing on ASCUS referrals. ASCUS referrals underwent randomized management [colposcopy for repeat cytology of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), colposcopy for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) detection or repeat HSIL, or immediate colposcopy]; then all were followed with repeat cytology for 2 years, followed by colposcopy and aggressive treatment. We assessed all CIN3 lesions qualitatively and measured 39 of them. CIN3 lesions were overwhelmingly small. Compared with enrollment, lesions found at follow-up or exit involved fewer tissue fragments (P {\textless} 0.01) and showed less diffuse gland involvement (P = 0.03). CIN3 lesions found postenrollment after HPV testing involved the fewest tissue fragments [versus immediate colposcopy (P = 0.04) or repeat cytology of HSIL (P = 0.02)], and none showed diffuse gland involvement. The median distal-proximal length was 6.5 mm (median replacement of total epithelium = 5\%) in the 39 measured cases. We conclude that CIN3 lesions underlying ASCUS or LSIL generally lack features associated with invasion, particularly if managed using HPV testing, suggesting that aggressive management leads to early detection of CIN3 but probably prevents relatively few cancers in screened populations.}

Trends in smoking prevalence suggest that, while the prevalence in men increased earlier than women, more male smokers have quit than their female counterparts. These trends in smoking prevalence suggest striking gender differences in a period effect for the smoking prevalence. Estimates of the proportion of current smokers, ex-smokers, and the mean duration of smoking were used in a model for the lung cancer incidence rates. The form for the relationship between smoking history and the incidence rate for these subgroups was based on information from cohort studies. The models represented a mixture of the smoking subgroups where the effect of smoking was considered to be either a multiplicative effect on the underlying age distribution, or a separate effect in which the level of exposure was the sole contribution to risk among smokers. The multiplicative model explained more than 80 per cent of the deviance for the period and cohort effects, while the non-multiplicative model could only account for trends in females. Hence, these results suggest that a sizeable portion of the period and cohort contributions to the lung cancer incidence trends in Connecticut can be attributed to the multiplicative model that utilizes this smoking information, although the lack of more detailed information is a limiting factor in developing the model.},

In this article, we present a rank-aggregation approach for combining results from several microarray studies. The motivation for this approach is twofold; first, the final results of microarray studies are typically expressed as lists of genes, rank-ordered by a measure of the strength of evidence that they are functionally involved in the disease process, and second, using the information on this rank-ordered metric means that we do not have to concern ourselves with data on the actual expression levels, which may not be comparable across experiments. Our approach draws on methods for combining top-k lists from the computer science literature on meta-search. The meta-search problem shares several important features with that of combining microarray experiments, including the fact that there are typically few lists with many elements and the elements may not be common to all lists. We implement two meta-search algorithms, which use a Markov chain framework to convert pairwise preferences between list elements into a stationary distribution that represents an aggregate ranking (Dwork et al, 2001). We explore the behavior of the algorithms in hypothetical examples and a simulated dataset and compare their performance with that of an algorithm based on the order-statistics model of Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927). We apply all three algorithms to aggregate the results of five microarray studies of prostate cancer.}

Product-moment correlation analysis was used to study the association between beta2-M, IgA and HIV RNA. A proportional hazards Cox model was used to estimate the relative hazard (RH) of death. Both beta2-M (r = 0.49, p {\textless} 0.0001) and IgA (r = 0.42, p {\textless} 0.0001) were positively correlated with HIV RNA. High beta2-M levels were associated with an increased risk of death in both univariate Cox analysis and after adjustment for HIV RNA, CD4 lymphocyte count and age [RH = 1.16 per 100 nmol/l higher beta2-M, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.27]. Raised IgA levels were associated with shorter survival in individuals with a CD4 count above 50 cells/mm3 in univariate analysis as well as after adjusting for age and CD4 lymphocyte count (RH = 1.19 per 10 micromol/l higher IgA, 95\% CI 1.01-1.39). However, this association was no longer significant after further adjusting for HIV RNA.

The purpose of this study is to correlate mortality with employment status in two cohorts of young Australian males, aged 17-25 years, from 1984 to 1988. Two youth cohorts consisting of an initially unemployed sample (n = 1424 males) and a population sample (n = 4573 males), were surveyed annually throughout the study period. Those lost to follow-up during the survey period were matched with death registries across Australia. Employment status was determined from weekly diaries and death certificates and was designated as: employed or student; unemployed; not in the work force (excluding students). Conditional logistic regression, using age- and cohort- matched cases (deaths) and controls (alive), was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of dying with regard to employment status, taking into account potential confounders such as ethnicity, aboriginality, educational attainment, pre-existing health problems, socio-economic status of parents, and other factors. Twenty three male survey respondents were positively matched to death registry records. Compared to those employed or students (referent group), significantly elevated ORs were found to be associated with neither being in the workforce nor a student for all cause, external cause, and external cause mortality other than suicide. Odds ratios were adjusted for age, survey cohort, ethnicity, pre-existing physical and mental health status, education level, and socio-economic status of parent(s). A statistically significant increasing linear trend in odds ratios of male mortality for most cause groups was found across the employment categories, from those employed or student (lowest ORs), through those unemployed, to those not in the workforce (highest ORs). Suicide was higher, but not statistically significantly, in those unemployed or not in the workforce. Suicide also was associated, though not significantly, with the respondent not living with their parents when they were 14 years of age. No association was found between mortality and past unemployment experience, as measured by length of time spent unemployed, or the number of spells of unemployment experienced during the survey. The results of this study underscore the elevated risk to survival in young males as a consequence of being neither employed nor a student.}

METHODS: Trends in age-specific incidence of invasive breast cancers in NSW women aged {\textgreater} or = 40 years were examined in relation to mammography screening rates and screening cancer detection rates. RESULTS: Incidence of invasive breast cancer in NSW women increased in all age-groups over 1972 to 2002. The incidence trend for women aged 50 to 69 years showed that the steepest rise was associated with increased participation in population-based mammography screening, which was implemented from 1988 and achieved state-wide coverage in 1995. The elevated incidence of invasive cancer significantly exceeded pre-screening levels, and persisted after rates of initial screens declined. This elevated incidence was sustained by the contribution of cancers diagnosed through subsequent screening, and resulted from increased cancer detection rates in subsequent screens. CONCLUSIONS: The recent increase in invasive breast cancer incidence in NSW is associated with mammography screening, and occurred mostly in the target age-group women. Persistence of higher incidence after 1994 was not explicable by inflation of cancer incidence due to detection of prevalent screen cases, but was associated with a trend of increased cancer detection rates in subsequent screening rounds, probably consequent to quality improvements in mammography screening diagnosis.}

Before a new disease screening test is approved for public use, its accuracy should be shown to be better than or at least not inferior to an existing test. Standards do not yet exist for designing and analysing studies to address this issue. Established principles for the design of therapeutic studies can be adapted for studies of screening tests. In particular, drawing upon methods for superiority and non-inferiority studies of therapeutic agents, we propose that confidence intervals for the relative accuracy of dichotomous tests drive the design of comparative studies of disease screening tests. We derive sample size formulae for a variety of designs, including studies where patients undergo several tests and studies where patients receive only one of the tests under evaluation. Both cohort and case-control study designs are considered. Modifications to the confidence intervals and sample size formulae are discussed to accommodate studies where, because of the invasive nature of definitive testing, true disease status can only be obtained for subjects who are positive on one or more of the screening tests. The methods proposed are applied to a study comparing a modified pap test to the conventional pap for cervical cancer screening. The impact of error in the gold standard reference test on the design and evaluation of comparative screening test studies is also discussed.},

Reactivity to subcomponent p24 was better than that to whole HIV; reactivity was present in five of six infected persons and increased with the addition of exogenous interleukin-2. Reactivities to subcomponents (g)p41 and gp120 were also measured. This is the first evidence of a specific cell-mediated immune response to HIV antigen in HIV-infected persons. Monkeys immunized with purified HIV or with purified p24 displayed cellular immunoreactivity both to whole HIV and to subcomponents. In contrast to the poor reactivity to HIV antigen, the lymphocytes of the patients had good specific cell proliferation responses to cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus challenge and a normal response to the addition of phytohemagglutinin. The results suggest a functional defect in peripheral lymphocytes of some HIV-infected individuals on the basis of their response to whole HIV antigen and a better response to gag protein.}

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Intestinal obstruction is one of the most common postoperative complications after nephrectomy for nephroblastoma. However, few reports have evaluated risk factors for SBO. Radiation therapy has been associated with increased intestinal complications in some adult cancer patients, but this has not been reported in children undergoing cancer surgery. METHODS: Postoperative SBO occurred in 131 of 1,910 children (6.9\%) enrolled in the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS). The etiology of the SBO was bowel adhesions in 104 cases, intussusception in 17, internal hernia in 2, and uncertain in the remaining 8 children. RESULTS: The factors found to be of potential importance in explaining the incidence of SBO were higher local tumor stage, extrarenal intravascular involvement, and en bloc resection of other organs at the time of nephrectomy. The incidence of postoperative SBO was not increased in children who received postoperative radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall incidence of SBO after nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor is comparable to that after other major abdominal operations in children, it can be responsible for significant morbidity. There were 4 children among the 1,910 patients with infectious complications of SBO, which contributed to their death.}

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is currently commonly performed, either within or outside large high-volume centres. The aim of this study was to assess the 30-day mortality rate after RP in Sweden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this nationwide population-based study, all men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer ({\textless} or =70 years, clinical stadium T1-2, prostate-specific antigen {\textless} 20 ng/ml) who underwent RP in Sweden between 1997 and 2002 were identified through the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR). Mortality within 30 days of RP was analysed through linkage between the follow-up study of the NPCR and the Regional Population Registers. The cause of death in the death certificates were compared with data from the hospitals concerned. To validate the results, a record linkage between the Inpatient Register and the National Population Register was also performed. RESULTS: The number of RPs performed increased over time. Among 3700 RPs performed, four deaths occurred during the first 30 days, yielding a 0.11\% 30-day mortality rate. These deaths occurred at three different types of hospital and were all probably related to the RP. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that RP is a procedure with very low perioperative mortality even when performed outside high-volume centres.}

The study was designed to examine the role of active smoking and other known or suspected factors. Data collected by personal interviews during the 15 months of a hospital-based case control study are reported. A total of 140 microscopically confirmed cases and 280 frequency-matched controls were analysed using multiple logistic regression. Cigarette smoking was the most important factor associated with excess risk for lung cancer among women. Significantly increased risk was found both among current smokers (OR=11.20, 95\% CI 5.9-21.2), and ex-smokers (OR=10.02, 95\% CI 5.5-18.4). Positive dose-response gradients (P{\textless}0.001) were observed between lung cancer risk and the daily number of cigarettes, duration of smoking, number of pack-years, inhaling, and grade of nicotine dependence assessed by the Fagerstrom test (Heatherton TF, Kozlowski LT, Frecker RC, Fagerstrom KO. Br J Addict 1991;86:1119-1470; Pomerleau OF. In: Bolliger CT, Fagerstrom KO, editors. The Tobacco Epidemic. Basle: Karger, 1997: 122-131). Exposure to environmental smoke was associated with elevated lung cancer risk (OR=3.58, for lifetime non-smokers exposed both in childhood and in adult age). Physical exercise and body mass index were inversely associated with lung cancer risk. For the category of physical exercise of more than 5 h per week, the odds ratio was 0.38, compared to subjects admitting no physical exercise. For body mass index, the odds ratio for the highest (compared to the lowest) quartile was 0.50. Chronic cough and phlegm (at least 3 months per year) were associated with excess risk (OR=6.07) only if their duration was less than 2 years before diagnosis of lung cancer, and, therefore, they were suspected of being more likely early symptoms of preclinical lung cancer rather than its cause. Our results support the statement that cigarette smoking is by far the most important cause of the on-going epidemic of lung cancer among Czech women, and are consistent with the concept of a balance between risk and protective factors whose eventual maintenance or alteration determine the development of disease (as suggested by Rylander R, Axelsson G, Andersson L, Liljequist T, Bergman B. Lung Cancer 1996;14(Suppl 1): S75-S83). Concerted control of smoking appears to be an urgent priority in lung cancer prevention among women, including specific approaches targeted on the female population.}

We analysed mesothelioma mortality since 1968 to assess the current state of the mesothelioma epidemic, and to predict its future course. We found that rates of mesothelioma in men formed a clear pattern defined by age and date of birth. Rates rose steeply with age showing a very similar pattern in all five-year birth cohorts. By date of birth, rates increased from mid-1893 to mid-1948, and then fell. Relative to the 1943-48 cohort, the risk for the 1948-53 cohort is 0.79 and for the 1953-58 cohort 0.48. Despite these falls, if the age profile of rates for these cohorts follows the pattern of past cohorts, their predicted lifetime mesothelioma risks will be 1.3\%, 1.0\%, and 0.6\%. Combining projections for all cohorts results in a peak of annual male mesothelioma deaths in about the year 2020 of between 2700 and 3300 deaths. If diagnostic trend is responsible for a 20\% growth in recorded cases every 5 years--an extreme but arguable case--and if this trend has now ceased, the peak of annual male deaths will be reduced to 1300, reached around the year 2010. Analysis of occupations recorded on death certificates indicate that building workers, especially plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters and electricians are the largest high-risk group. These data indicate that mesothelioma deaths will continue to increase for at least 15 and more likely 25 years. For the worst affected cohorts--men born in the 1940s--mesothelioma may account for around 1\% of all deaths. Asbestos exposure at work in construction and building maintenance will account for a large proportion of these deaths, and it is important that such workers should be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions.}

Two unobserved fractions are of interest, with only a single response per table, and it is this non-identifiability that is the inherent difficulty lying at the heart of ecological inference. Many methods have been suggested for ecological inference, often without a probabilistic model; we clarify the form of the sampling distribution and critique previous approaches within a formal statistical framework, thus allowing clarification and examination of the assumptions that are required under all approaches. A particularly difficult problem is choosing between models with and without contextual effects. Various Bayesian hierarchical modelling approaches are proposed to allow the formal inclusion of supplementary data, and/or prior information, without which ecological inference is unreliable. Careful choice of the prior within such models is required, however, since there may be considerable sensitivity to this choice, even when the model assumed is correct and there are no contextual effects. This sensitivity is shown to be a function of the number of areas and the distribution of the proportions in the fixed margin across areas. By explicitly providing a likelihood for each table, the combination of individual level survey data and aggregate level data is straightforward and we illustrate that survey data can be highly informative, particularly if these data are from a survey of the minority population within each area. This strategy is related to designs that are used in survey sampling and in epidemiology. An approximation to the suggested likelihood is discussed, and various computational approaches are described. Some extensions are outlined including the consideration of multiway tables, spatial dependence and area-specific (contextual) variables. Voter registration-race data from 64 counties in the US state of Louisiana are used to illustrate the methods.},

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3\% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5\% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0\% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80\% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3\%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

In this application the AIDS incubation time is replaced by the time from HIV infection to AIDS death. Since AIDS is an irreversible condition leading to death within a few years, mortality data is expected to be approximately as informative as AIDS data. The main application of this method would be in countries where an AIDS registry is not available or where the registration of AIDS cases is not consistent, for example, due to changes in the definition of AIDS. Application to the Italian AIDS mortality data shows that the number of AIDS cases reconstructed from this method is very close to the registered number of cases. Also, the two estimates of HIV incidence and prevalence obtained from back-calculation on both AIDS mortality data and the number of AIDS reported cases were very similar, although there was more variability in the estimates obtained from mortality data.}

For example, period analysis reveals that 10 year RSR have come close to (or even exceed) 80\% for cancer of the corpus uteri and melanoma, 75\% for breast cancer, 70\% for bladder cancer, 65\% for cancer of the cervix uteri, and 55\% for cancer of the colon and prostate. Period analysis further reveals that 20 year RSR have now come close to (or even exceed) 75\% for endometrial cancer and melanoma, 60\% for breast cancer and cervical cancer, 55\% for colon cancer and bladder cancer, and 40\%-50\% for cancer of the rectum, the ovaries, kidneys and nervous system.}

METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Registry, and EMBASE were searched from January 1985 to January 2003. Any primary care-based intervention using a controlled trial, quasi-experimental, or pre-post design that targeted breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer was included if at least 5\% of the sample was Latino. RESULTS: A total of 14 intervention studies met inclusion criteria. Seven of the 14 studies described patient or provider reminder interventions. Other interventions incorporated into the primary care setting one of the following: community health educators, culturally sensitive videos, audit with feedback, materials from the "Put Prevention Into Practice" campaign, and vouchers for free screenings. The heterogeneity of designs and outcome variables and the low number of Latinos presented obstacles to combining data to estimate the overall effectiveness of primary care interventions for this population. Qualitatively, patient and physician reminders and management systems strategies including audit with feedback for providers appear to result in improved screening utilization. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of primary care cancer control interventions directed at Latinos. Primary care-based interventions that have been effective in non-Latinos could incorporate culturally appropriate elements and lessons from community-based research and could be applied to Latinos so that their effectiveness can be assessed in this group.}

In studies of disease natural history, the duration of the asymptomatic period is of interest-in AIDS, to predict the epidemic's course, and in cancer, to develop efficient screening strategies. This article provides a bridge between the two fields with respect to estimation of the asymptomatic period. By adapting AIDS methodology to cancer, the article identifies a non-parametric method for estimating the duration of the asymptomatic period in cancer. The method is similar to one developed by Louis et al. (Mathematical Biosciences, 40, 111-144 (1978)), and is designed to apply to data from a cohort of individuals, screened periodically. After reviewing the similarities and differences between the AIDS and cancer contexts, we develop an EM algorithm that, at convergence, yields a maximum or saddle point of the likelihood. We investigate the performance of the algorithm by means of a simulation study, explore the effect of adding a smoothing step to the estimation procedure, and adapt the method for use with a data set in which disease prevalence is low. We apply the method to data from the HIP breast cancer screening trial.}

	abstract = {In high throughput genomic studies, an important goal is to identify a small number of genomic markers that are associated with development and progression of diseases. A representative example is microarray prognostic studies, where the goal is to identify genes whose expressions are associated with disease free or overall survival. Because of the high dimensionality of gene expression data, standard survival analysis techniques cannot be directly applied. In addition, among the thousands of genes surveyed, only a subset are disease-associated. Gene selection is needed along with estimation. In this article, we model the relationship between gene expressions and survival using the accelerated failure time (AFT) models. We use the bridge penalization for regularized estimation and gene selection. An efficient iterative computational algorithm is proposed. Tuning parameters are selected using V-fold cross validation. We use a resampling method to evaluate the prediction performance of bridge estimator and the relative stability of identified genes. We show that the proposed bridge estimator is selection consistent under appropriate conditions. Analysis of two lymphoma prognostic studies suggests that the bridge estimator can identify a small number of genes and can have better prediction performance than the Lasso.},

This situation occurs commonly in many domains of application, particularly in disease mapping. We assume that the counts follow a Poisson model at the lowest level of the hierarchy, and introduce a finite-mixture model for the Poisson rates at the next level. The novelty lies in the model for allocation to the mixture components, which follows a spatially correlated process, the Potts model, and in treating the number of components of the spatial mixture as unknown. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. The model introduced can be viewed as a Bayesian semiparametric approach to specifying flexible spatial distribution in hierarchical models. Performance of the model and comparison with an alternative well-known Markov random field specification for the Poisson rates are demonstrated on synthetic datasets. We show that our allocation model avoids the problem of oversmoothing in cases where the underlying rates exhibit discontinuities, while giving equally good results in cases of smooth gradient-like or highly autocorrelated rates. The methodology is illustrated on an epidemiologic application to data on a rare cancer in France.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

More than 1 million prostate biopsies are conducted yearly in the United States. The low specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results in diagnostic biopsies in men without prostate cancer (PCa). Additional information, such as genetic markers, could be used to avoid unnecessary biopsies.


OBJECTIVE

To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCa can be used to determine whether biopsy of the prostate is necessary. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Stockholm-1 cohort (n = 5241) consisted of men who underwent a prostate biopsy during 2005 to 2007. PSA levels were retrieved from databases and family histories were obtained using a questionnaire. Thirty-five validated SNPs were analysed and converted into a genetic risk score that was implemented in a risk-prediction model.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS

When comparing the nongenetic model (based on age, PSA, free-to-total PSA, and family history) with the genetic model and using a fixed number of detected PCa cases, it was found that the genetic model required significantly fewer biopsies than the nongenetic model, with 480 biopsies (22.7\%) avoided, at a cost of missing a PCa diagnosis in 3\% of patients characterised as having an aggressive disease. However, the overall genetic model does not discriminate between aggressive and nonaggressive cases.


CONCLUSION

Although the genetic model reduced the number of biopsies more than the nongenetic model, the clinical significance of this finding requires further evaluation.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75\% for conventional cytology and 84\% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86\% for conventional cytology and 90\% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87\% and 91\%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing had a cost of \$174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 5 years) had a cost of \$59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or immediate colposcopy conducted biennially. CONCLUSION: Reflex HPV DNA testing provides the same or greater life expectancy benefits and is more cost-effective than other management strategies for women diagnosed as having ASC-US.}

Micronutrient levels were estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and measured from blood samples. Information on risk factors for cervical neoplasia was elicited by interview. Hybrid capture was used to determine infection with human papillomavirus. After adjustment for potential confounders, analysis of micronutrient levels estimated from the FFQ suggested that women in the upper tertile of lycopene and vitamin A intake were one-third (odds ratio = 0.32, 95\% confidence interval = 0.8-1.3) and one-fourth (odds ratio = 0.24, 95\% confidence interval = 0.05-1.2) as likely, respectively, to have dysplasia as women in the lower tertile. Borderline protective trends (p {\textless} or = 0.10) were apparent. Elevated levels of serum lycopene also suggested some protection against dysplasia. Results were not significant at alpha = 0.05 because of the small number of case women enrolled. Overall, correlations between estimates from the FFQ and serum levels were poor. This study indicates that, among black women, lycopene and perhaps vitamin A may play a protective role in the early stages of cervical carcinogenesis.}

METHODS. The Washington State Community Breast Cancer Screening Project involved implementation of promotional activities initiated by physician and lay community boards in two communities. Two comparable communities served as controls for evaluation purposes. Random-digit-dial telephone interviews were used to assess recent use of mammography at baseline and follow-up in independent samples of women ages 50 to 75 from the four communities. The extent of exposure to intervention activities and the relationship between exposure to intervention activities and mammography use were estimated from data collected at follow-up. RESULTS. Exposure to patient reminders from physicians, wallet reminder cards, and newspaper advertisements were consistently related to mammography use. Physician office staff encouragement and a display board were significantly related to mammography use only in Intervention Communities A and B, respectively. Neither exposure to promotional activities nor the change in prevalence of mammography use was significantly higher in the intervention communities than in the comparison communities at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Although several activities were useful in promoting mammography use, organization of the community did not enhance efforts undertaken spontaneously by comparable communities.}

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Five-year relative survival data actually observed for patients diagnosed with 1 of 20 common forms of cancer in Finland in 36 overlapping 5-year periods between 1958-1962 and 1993-1997 were compared with period estimates and various variants of complete estimates of 5-year relative survival potentially available during these periods. RESULTS: At comparable levels of up-to-dateness, survival estimates from period analysis were more precise than survival estimates from complete analysis. At comparable levels of precision, period analysis provided more up-to-date survival estimates than did complete analysis. CONCLUSION: These results further encourage more widespread use of period analysis as a standard tool for up-to-date monitoring of cancer patient survival by population-based cancer registries.}

It is possible that a major government youth suicide prevention initiative, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (NYSPS), implemented during 1995-1999 may have influenced the decline. In this article, we examine time trends in age- and means-specific male and female Australian suicide rates in relation to unemployment rates and the NYSPS. Based on Australian suicide data over the period 1966-2003, we assess secular changes in the 20-24 year male suicide to total (crude) male suicide rate ratio in relation to the NYSPS, using interrupted time series analysis (ARIMA), since this was previously found to be significantly associated with the 20-24 year male unemployment to total employment ratio. Results show that a dramatic reduction in Australian young male (aged 20-34 years) suicide has occurred since 1997-1998, declining from approximately 40 per 100,000 in 1997-1998 to approximately 20 per 100,000 in 2003. Most of the decline is due to a decrease in suicide by hanging and to a lesser extent from motor vehicle carbon monoxide and other gases. Further, the previously established strong secular association (lasting over 3 decades from 1966) between the rate ratio of 20-24 year male suicide to total (crude) male suicide, and the rate ratio of 20-24 year male unemployment to total unemployment, appears to have been disrupted. ARIMA modelling of the suicide ratio against the initiative indicates a highly significant statistical association between the NYSPS and the suicide ratio reduction but not between the NYSPS and the unemployment indicator trend, suggesting a break in the link between young male suicide and unemployment. The recent sudden turnaround in Australian young male suicide trends and its extent appears to preclude explanations centring on slow-moving social indices traditionally associated with suicide, or on possible cohort effects. This sudden decrease has occurred mainly in non-impulsive means, and at the same time has broken a long-standing secular link between 20 and 24-year-male suicide and unemployment, lending plausibility to the case for the NYSPS having had an impact on young male suicide in Australia.}

To investigate this, screening rates in a cohort of women with Vietnamese surnames were estimated and compared with survey data. METHODS: A cohort of women with common Vietnamese surnames was extracted from the NSW electoral roll and matched over three periods with data held on the NSW Pap Test Register (PTR), and estimates of cervical screening in the cohort derived. Screening rates for each of the three periods were pro-rated to biennial rates, and time-related changes compared. Screening rates in the cohort were also compared to those in Vietnamese migrant respondents to a population-based health interview survey. RESULTS: Estimated biennial screening rates in the overall Vietnamese nominal cohort of women aged 20-69 years were significantly and substantially lower than those for NSW overall, by 10-12 percentage points. Screening rates in the Vietnamese cohort were found to increase over the study period, from 44\% for 1997/98 to 47\% for 1998/99. While the biennial screening rate for 1998 in the nominal cohort was 19 percentage points lower than the self-reported surveyed screening rate of 63\%, the relative screening ratios between Vietnamese and all NSW women were similar for both data sources. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating and monitoring cervical screening participation in minority groups with distinctive names using a Pap Test Register and information from a population register.}

As part of the Sydney Airport Health Study, residents in each of these 3 expected-change areas (N=1015) completed a structured interview which included indices of noise reaction (including annoyance) and physical and mental health, prior to the anticipated changes. Concurrent (pre-change) measures of aircraft noise levels were taken. Self-reported physiological/health effects differed across areas with the same aircraft noise level consistently with differences in psychological reaction across these areas. Expected change in noise level added to the level of self-reported physiological symptoms predicted by noise level in regression analyses. Dose-response functions differed across the expected-change areas. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that noise exposure produces physiological symptoms, but that expectations regarding future noise levels also contribute to the physiological impact of noise, which may be reduced by addressing psychosocial factors related to noise reaction.}

The method compares the wire codes of case residences with the wire codes of specular residences constructed by switching the location of the case residence across the center of the street. The method was designed to discriminate between the magnetic field hypothesis, which postulates that childhood cancer is affected by magnetic fields and that wire codes are a proxy for magnetic fields, and the neighborhood hypothesis, which postulates that childhood cancer is affected by some characteristics of the neighborhood other than magnetic fields and that wire codes are a proxy for those characteristics. Although the results from the two applications of the method have limited precision, they support the results originally reported (odds ratios of around 2 for very high current configuration residences and childhood cancers) and do not support suggestions that the associations are due to confounding by socio-economic and neighborhood factors. The results leave open the question of whether or not control selection bias could have influenced the original associations, because there was no convincing evidence that the control-specular matrices were symmetric.}

	annote = {Surveillance data represent a vital resource for understanding the impact of cancer control interventions on the population cancer burden. However, population cancer trends are a complex product of many factors, and estimating the contribution of any one of these factors can be challenging. Surveillance modeling is a technique for estimating the contribution of one or more interventions of interest to trends in disease incidence and mortality. In this article, we present several approaches to surveillance modeling of cancer screening interventions. We classify models as biological or epidemiological, depending on whether they model the full unobservable aspects of disease onset and progression, or models which reduce the complex process to simpler terms by summarizing portions of the disease process using mostly observed population level measures. We also describe differences between macrolevel models, microsimulation models and mechanistic models. We discuss procedures for model calibration and validation, and methods for presenting model results which are robust with respect to certain types of biased model estimates. As examples, we present several models of the impact of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality, and PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality. Both these examples are appropriate uses of surveillance modeling, even though for mammography there is extensive (although somewhat controversial) randomized trial evidence, whereas for PSA this biomarker has seen extensive use as a screening test prior to any controlled trial evidence of its efficacy. Some of the models presented here were developed as part of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network.}

The magnitude of HIV RNA suppression correlated significantly with a decrease in activated CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD38+HLA-DR+), increases in naive CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD45RA+62L+), and increases in the delayed-type hypersensitivity score. However, changes in CASA did not correlate with changes in any T lymphocyte subset. CASA increases with improving immune function but appears more dependent on ongoing HIV replication.}

Viral sequencing of the reverse transcriptase gene was performed before therapy and during follow-up. HIV-1 RNA and DNA as well as CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets were measured in blood and in lymph node biopsies during therapy. Isolated blood CD4 T cells were cultured in conditions that improved HIV isolation. Three patients received in vivo interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon in order to try to identify intracellular pools of replication-competent virus. SETTING: A tertiary care general hospital. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients observed within 28 days following the acute retroviral syndrome. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 27.5+/-2.9 months, plasma RNA remained {\textless} 20 copies/ml (four patients), fluctuated between 20 and 120 copies/ml (six patients) or rebounded (five patients). M184V and/or T215Y mutations were demonstrated in two of these last five patients. Proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) decreased by an average of -1 log after 16+/-3 months, reaching undetectable levels in three patients. The culture of isolated CD4 T cells yielded virus in all but two patients. These last were characterized by a waning antibody reactivity on the Western blot, undetectable proviral DNA in PBMC and undetectable RNA in lymph nodes. Cytokine administration in vivo had no effect in one patient and unmasked plasma RNA in the other. Stopping therapy in the first patient led to a rebound in plasma RNA. CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of detectable plasma viral activity in some patients after 3 years of triple nucleoside therapy administered since the acute retroviral syndrome, replication-competent virus can still be demonstrated.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Several trials evaluating the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing on prostate-cancer mortality have shown conflicting results. We updated prostate-cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with 2 additional years of follow-up.


METHODS

The study involved 182,160 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years at entry, with a predefined core age group of 162,388 men 55 to 69 years of age. The trial was conducted in eight European countries. Men who were randomly assigned to the screening group were offered PSA-based screening, whereas those in the control group were not offered such screening. The primary outcome was mortality from prostate cancer.


RESULTS

After a median follow-up of 11 years in the core age group, the relative reduction in the risk of death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 21\% (rate ratio, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.91; P=0.001), and 29\% after adjustment for noncompliance. The absolute reduction in mortality in the screening group was 0.10 deaths per 1000 person-years or 1.07 deaths per 1000 men who underwent randomization. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer during follow-up years 10 and 11 was 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.85; P=0.003). To prevent one death from prostate cancer at 11 years of follow-up, 1055 men would need to be invited for screening and 37 cancers would need to be detected. There was no significant between-group difference in all-cause mortality.


CONCLUSIONS

Analyses after 2 additional years of follow-up consolidated our previous finding that PSA-based screening significantly reduced mortality from prostate cancer but did not affect all-cause mortality. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.).},

We tested the safety and the immune-modulating effects of combining cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during primary HIV-1 infection. Nine adults with primary HIV-1 infection were treated with CsA along with HAART. At week 8, all patients discontinued CsA but maintained HAART. Viral replication was suppressed to a comparable extent in the CsA + HAART cohort and in 29 control patients whose primary infection was treated with HAART alone. CsA restored normal CD4(+) T cell levels, both in terms of percentage and absolute numbers. The increase in CD4(+) T cells was apparent within a week and persisted throughout the study period. CsA was not detrimental to virus-specific CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses. At week 48, the proportion of IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) and CD4(+)CCR7(-) T cells was significantly higher in the CsA + HAART cohort than in the HAART-alone cohort. In conclusion, rapid shutdown of T cell activation in the early phases of primary HIV-1 infection can have long-term beneficial effects and establish a more favorable immunologic set-point. Appropriate, immune-based therapeutic interventions may represent a valuable complement to HAART for treating HIV infection.}

Patients with higher beta 2-microglobulin values tended to develop severe immunodeficiency/AIDS more rapidly than those with lower levels (relative risk 1.68 per 1 mg/L increase; 95\% CI 1.26-2.26; p = 0.0004). Older patients also progressed more rapidly, and these two factors acted independently (relative risk 1.65 per 1 mg/L increase; 95\% CI 1.21-2.72; p = 0.002 for beta 2-microglobulin and 1.22 per 10 years; 95\% CI 1.01-1.48; p = 0.04 for age). These results provide further evidence that the long-term course of HIV infection can, to some extent, be predicted soon after infection. Older patients with high beta 2-microglobulin levels warrant close monitoring and consideration for early antiretroviral therapy},

METHODS: Data were used from a recent update of a cohort mortality study of workers in a South Carolina textile factory. Alternative exposure-response models were evaluated with Poisson regression. A model designed to evaluate evidence of a threshold response was also fitted. Lifetime risks of lung cancer and asbestosis were estimated with an actuarial approach that accounts for competing causes of death. RESULTS: A highly significant exposure-response relation was found for both lung cancer and asbestosis. The exposure-response relation for lung cancer seemed to be linear on a multiplicative scale, which is consistent with previous analyses of lung cancer and exposure to asbestos. In contrast, the exposure-response relation for asbestosis seemed to be nonlinear on a multiplicative scale in this analysis. There was no significant evidence for a threshold in models of either the lung cancer or asbestosis. The excess lifetime risk for white men exposed for 45 years at the recently revised OSHA standard of 0.1 fibre/ml was predicted to be about 5/1000 for lung cancer, and 2/1000 for asbestosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the findings from previous investigations of a strong exposure-response relation between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and mortality from lung cancer, and asbestosis. The risk estimates for lung cancer derived from this analysis are higher than those derived from other populations exposed to chrysotile asbestos. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.}

The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel adds to the benefit of aspirin in acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation, but its effects in patients with ST-elevation MI were unclear. METHODS: 45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 h of suspected acute MI onset were randomly allocated clopidogrel 75 mg daily (n=22,961) or matching placebo (n=22,891) in addition to aspirin 162 mg daily. 93\% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7\% had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to 4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors) and 93\% of patients completed it. The two prespecified co-primary outcomes were: (1) the composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke; and (2) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were by intention to treat, and used the log-rank method. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00222573. FINDINGS: Allocation to clopidogrel produced a highly significant 9\% (95\% CI 3-14) proportional reduction in death, reinfarction, or stroke (2121 [9.2\%] clopidogrel vs 2310 [10.1\%] placebo; p=0.002), corresponding to nine (SE 3) fewer events per 1000 patients treated for about 2 weeks. There was also a significant 7\% (1-13) proportional reduction in any death (1726 [7.5\%] vs 1845 [8.1\%]; p=0.03). These effects on death, reinfarction, and stroke seemed consistent across a wide range of patients and independent of other treatments being used. Considering all fatal, transfused, or cerebral bleeds together, no significant excess risk was noted with clopidogrel, either overall (134 [0.58\%] vs 125 [0.55\%]; p=0.59), or in patients aged older than 70 years or in those given fibrinolytic therapy. INTERPRETATION: In a wide range of patients with acute MI, adding clopidogrel 75 mg daily to aspirin and other standard treatments (such as fibrinolytic therapy) safely reduces mortality and major vascular events in hospital, and should be considered routinely.}

In the present work we propose a method to calculate a correction factor of this bias in order to obtain an approximation to the total prevalence. METHODS \& STUDY DESIGN: The method is based on the relationship between relative survival and incidence by age for a specific cancer site. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide values of the correction factor, the completeness index R, relative to the most important cancer sites, for specific ages and periods of observation of the cancer registries in Italy. In addition, we provide indications for extended use of the index when substantial variations from the basic pattern of relative survival are observed in practical situations. Furthermore, we give helpful suggestions to obtain approximate values of the correction factor to be used for ages and periods of observation that are intermediate between the ones presented in this paper.}

Purpose: To update the 2002 and 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence reviews on screening and treatments for prostate cancer.  Data Sources: MEDLINE (2002 to July 2011) and the Cochrane Library Database (through second quarter of 2011).  Study Selection: Randomized trials of prostate-specific antigen-based screening, randomized trials and cohort studies of prostatectomy or radiation therapy versus watchful waiting, and large observational studies of perioperative harms.  Data Extraction: Investigators abstracted and checked study details and quality using predefined criteria.  Data Synthesis: Of 5 screening trials, the 2 largest and highest-quality studies reported conflicting results. One found screening was associated with reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with no screening in a subgroup of men age 55 to 69 years after 9 years (relative risk, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.65 to 0.98]; absolute risk reduction, 0.07 percentage point). The other found no statistically significant effect after 10 years (relative risk, 1.1 [CI, 0.80 to 1.5]). After 3 or 4 screening rounds, 12\% to 13\% of screened men had false-positive results. Serious infections or urinary retention occurred after 0.5\% to 1.0\% of prostate biopsies. There were 3 randomized trials and 23 cohort studies of treatments. One good-quality trial found that prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer decreased risk for prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with watchful waiting through 13 years of follow-up (relative risk, 0.62 [CI, 0.44 to 0.87]; absolute risk reduction, 6.1\%). Benefits appeared limited to men younger than 65 years of age. Treating approximately 3 men with prostatectomy or 7 men with radiation therapy instead of watchful waiting would each result in 1 additional case of erectile dysfunction. Treating approximately 5 men with prostatectomy would result in 1 additional case of urinary incontinence. Prostatectomy was associated with perioperative death (about 0.5\%) and cardiovascular events (0.6\% to 3\%), and radiation therapy was associated with bowel dysfunction.  Limitation: Only English-language articles were included. Few studies evaluated newer therapies.  Conclusion: Prostate-specific antigen-based screening results in small or no reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality and is associated with harms related to subsequent evaluation and treatments, some of which may be unnecessary.

We show that, under certain conditions, nondifferential misclassification of such a binary covariate does not reduce the ability to control confounding by the covariate in ecologic studies. Thus, any remaining exposure-disease association in an adjusted ecologic analysis cannot be ascribed to incomplete control for confounding due to nondifferential misclassification of the dichotomy under those conditions, although residual confounding by the underlying covariate may still be present. This point is illustrated by ecologic analyses of the association between population density and mortality from lung cancer in women in 30 administrative districts of the Federal Republic of Germany, in which control for cigarette smoking is required.}

Purpose and Methods: To estimate the number of mutations required for colon carcinogenesis, we used likelihood analysis to obtain the best fit between mathematical models postulating different numbers of rate-limiting events and data on incidence rates of colon cancer in two human populations-the general population of Birmingham, England, from 1968 to 1972 and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) diagnosed at Saint Mark's Hospital, London, England, between 1925 and 1965. The Armitage-Doll model and two- and three-mutation models that explicitly incorporated cell proliferation kinetics were used. Results: When cell kinetics were considered, models postulating either two or three rate-limiting events described the incidence rates of colon cancer equally well in both human populations. A comparison of the incidence rate of colon cancer in the general population with that in patients with polyposis suggests that a mutation at the FAP gene locus is not one of the rate-limiting events in colon carcinogenesis. Conclusions: Compared with the two-mutation model, the three-mutation model was more consistent with the number of mutations reported to date in colon cancer and with mutation rates measured in the laboratory. Implications: A mutation at the FAP locus may not be a rate-limiting step but may act indirectly by stimulating the proliferation of stem cells. Thus, the development of colon cancer in patients with FAP does not appear to fit the retinoblastoma paradigm.},

RESULTS: From 1988-1995 there were 1493 discharges from New Zealand hospitals with injury as the result of fire and flame in domestic locations. Age-standardised hospitalisation rates for fire related injury over the period have been stable, with an overall discharge rate of 5.45 hospitalisations per 100000 person years. Male discharges exceeded female in all years (RR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.73-2.14). Stratification by age indicated that discharge rates were highest among New Zealanders aged over 75 years and under fifteen years. Maori discharge rates exceeded non-Maori over all age groups (RR 3.3, 95\% CI 2.82-3.58). CONCLUSION: Maori discharge rates for fire related injury in the home are substantially higher than non-Maori in all age groups, and highlight the importance of developing culturally appropriate injury prevention strategies. Social and material determinants of injury need to be addressed through public policy, provision of quality housing and community development initiatives.}

Extrapolating these trends to the year 2000, the US prevalence will be 21\% and the Canadian prevalence 24\%.Conclusions. If the current trends continue, the Canadian goal seems attainable, but the US goal does not. The US goal is reachable only for 65-to 80-year-olds, who already have low smoking prevalences.

We examined a total of 48 screening strategies, depending on the age range, the examination interval, and whether mammography or CBE is given at every one or two exam. Our results indicate that a biennial mammography can be cost-effective if coupled with annual CBE. For each screening interval and starting age, giving mammography every two exams and CBE at every exam has the lowest marginal cost per year of quality-adjusted life saved, whereas giving both at every exam has the highest. Comparing annual mammography and CBE to biennial mammography and annual CBE from 50 to 79, the total cost was reduced by 35\%, whereas the marginal quality-adjusted life years only decreased by 12\%. Similar reductions are observed for other starting ages. It is cost-effective to have a biennial mammography if coupled with an annual CBE. Annual mammography combined with CBE every 6 months will lead to a 41\% increase in the quality-adjusted life years compared with annual mammography and CBE from 50 to 79, whereas the total cost increases by 30\%.}

In this study, we have added resolution to the analysis of seasonality in cancer survival by considering mortality within several nonoverlapping time periods following diagnosis, thereby quantifying the separate contributions of mechanisms operating in the short term and in the longer term. We found evidence of seasonality acting on mortality within 2 distinct periods following diagnosis. Diagnosis in the summer was associated with substantially decreased mortality within the first month of diagnosis compared with winter in men with prostate cancer, those of both sexes with colorectal or lung cancer, and most strikingly, amongst women with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.81 [95\% confidence interval 0.75-0.86]). Adjusting for monthly variations in general mortality greatly attenuated the seasonal effects on short-term mortality. At long-term follow-up ({\textgreater}5 years), there was a consistent shift in the seasonality pattern, with autumn diagnosis alone being associated with decreased mortality, both in female breast cancer cases and in lung cancer cases of both sexes. We conclude that the higher survival observed amongst patients diagnosed in summer and autumn is predominantly a short-term phenomenon that is largely attributable to generally higher mortality in winter. However, the distinct mortality reduction observed in the long term amongst those diagnosed in the autumn, especially amongst breast cancer patients, may indicate the presence of a seasonally variable protective mechanism.}

This showed that the in vivo rate of increase in plasma virus load immediately after transient therapy provides a measure of the viral replicative capacity. Thus, the hypothesis that progression of HIV infection involves an increase in viral replicative capacity can be tested by measuring this viral growth rate in patients with high CD4 counts and in patients with low CD4 counts. Studies should thus investigate dynamics of changes in virus levels after stopping antiretroviral therapy and, in particular, measure rates of increase in virus in patients at high and low CD4 counts. In practice, such data may assist in therapeutic management of patients with HIV infection},

SETTING: Seventy-five inner-Sydney primary schools. PARTICIPANTS: School children aged 8-9 years at baseline and 11-12 years at follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP). STUDY FACTORS: Current weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHR), weight gain since birth and birth weight. Potential confounders: age, sex and socioeconomic status (on the basis of the area of residence). RESULTS: Current weight was significantly associated with both SBP and DBP in boys and girls at baseline and follow-up. BMI and WC were similar predictors of SBP and DBP in each survey, but longitudinal BMI change has a stronger association with SBP (r=0.43, P{\textless}0.001) and DBP (r=0.26, P{\textless}0.001) than changes in WC (r=0.18, P{\textless}0.001 for SBP and r=0.16, P{\textless}0.001 for DBP) and WHR in boys with the similar results for girls. The unadjusted associations between SBP and DBP and birthweight were nonsignificant. After adjustments for age, height and socioeconomic status, however, the association becomes negative and significant in boys (beta=-1.47, P=0.04 for SBP and beta=-1.33, P=0.03 for DBP). CONCLUSION: Longitudinal change in BMI is a better predictor of BP than change in WC or the WHR, although cross-sectional measurements of BMI and WC are very similar predictors of BP. In preventing subsequent adverse effects on BP, attending to body weight during childhood is important.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. The prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE). Mortality after 7-10 years of follow-up has been reported previously. We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial.

METHODS. A total of 76 685 men, aged 55-74 years, were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and randomly assigned to the intervention (organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years; 38 340 men) and control (usual care, which sometimes included opportunistic screening; 38 345 men) arms. Screening was completed in October 2006. All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31, 2009, were ascertained. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms, and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events. Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age, comorbidity status, and pretrial PSA testing. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS. Approximately 92\% of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57\% to 13 years. At 13 years, 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm. Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a relative increase of 12\% in the intervention arm (RR = 1.12, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 1.17). After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms (RR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 0.87 to 1.36). No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age (P(interaction) = .81), pretrial PSA testing (P(interaction) = .52), and comorbidity (P(interaction) = .68).

CONCLUSIONS. After 13 years of follow-up, there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening, which forms part of usual care, and there was no apparent interaction with age, baseline comorbidity, or pretrial PSA testing.},

METHODS: This paper reviews the published literature from 1966 to July 2002 to assess three potential pathways underlying this excess mortality--high human papilloma virus (HPV) prevalence, lack of or infrequent screening and advanced disease at diagnosis, and under-use of recommended treatment and shorter survival. FINDINGS: Living in rural areas may impose barriers to cervical cancer control, including lack of transportation and medical care infrastructures. Population characteristics that place women at greater risk for developing and dying from cervical cancer, such as low income, lack of health insurance, and physician availability, are concentrated in rural areas. Published data, however, are insufficient to identify the key reasons for the observed mortality patterns. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, given the lack of definitive evidence in the published literature, decisions about priorities in areas with high rates of cervical cancer mortality will depend on knowledge of current levels of screening, incidence, and stage distribution; and service delivery infrastructures, resources, and acceptability of interventions to the target population.}

Quintiles of SES were defined by municipality of residence and comparisons of suicide by SES were adjusted for age and country (or region) of birth (COB), and examined by COB. Risk of suicide in females was 28\% that of males for all adults and 21\% for youth (age 15-24 yr). Suicide risk was lower in males from southern Europe, Middle East and Asia, and higher in northern and eastern European males, compared to the Australian-born. Risks for suicide increased significantly with decreasing SES in males, but not in females. The relationship of male suicide and SES was stronger when controlled for COB. For males, the relative risk of suicide, adjusted for age and COB, was 66\% higher in the lowest SES quintile compared to the highest quintile. and 39\% higher for youth (age 15-24 yr). For male suicide, the population attributable fraction for SES (less than the highest quintile) was 27\%. Analysis of SES differentials in male suicide according to COB indicated a significant inverse suicide gradient in relation to SES for the Australian-born and those born in New Zealand and the United Kingdom or Eire, but not in non-English speaking COB groups, except for Asia. For Australian-born males, suicide risk was 71\% higher in the lowest SES group (compared to the highest), adjusted for age. These findings indicate that SES plays an important role in male suicide rates among the Australian-born and migrants from English-speaking countries and Asia, and among youth; but not in female suicide, nor suicide in most non-English speaking migrant groups. Reduction in SES differentials through economic and social policies may reduce male suicide in lower SES groups and should be seen to be at least as important as individual level interventions.}

Tamoxifen use is associated with an increased risk of potentially serious adverse events, principally endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolic events and, therefore, detailed knowledge of the effects of tamoxifen is important. With more cases of breast cancer being found as the follow-up time increases, it is now possible to perform more detailed analysis of the Italian Randomized Trial of Tamoxifen. Women with hysterectomy (N = 5408) were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg tamoxifen per day (N = 2700) or placebo (N = 2708). After a median of 81.2 months of follow-up, 79 case subjects (34 in the tamoxifen arm and 45 in the placebo arm) were diagnosed with breast cancer. We were able to identify a group of women at increased risk of ER+ breast cancers (high-risk group) on the basis of baseline as well as reproductive and hormonal characteristics (height, age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, and oophorectomy). Tamoxifen administered to women in the high-risk group showed statistically significantly reduced incidence of breast cancer (tamoxifen, 3 and placebo, 15; P =.003), but no such effect was seen in the low-risk group (tamoxifen, 31 and placebo, 30; P =.89). The positive effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer among high-risk women is most marked for ER+ tumors (tamoxifen, 1 and placebo, 11; P =.002). Chemoprevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen appears to be effective in women at high risk of ER+ tumors but not among women at low risk, who may well be protected naturally by late age at menarche or early first pregnancy, or artificially by removal of the ovaries. Tamoxifen could be offered as a preventive agent to women identified at high-risk of breast cancer because of hormone-related risk factors. Such a strategy would greatly reduce the numbers of women who would need to take tamoxifen to obtain the same absolute reduction in breast cancer. These findings are exploratory and need to be confirmed in other randomized trials.}

The authors identified the effect of TURP-detected prostate cancer on the observed incidence rates between 1973 and 1993 for men aged 65 years and older. They linked population-based cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program to Medicare records between 1986 and 1993 to determine whether a TURP occurred sufficiently close to the time of a prostate cancer diagnosis for them to assume that it led to the diagnosis. TURP-detected cases prior to 1986 were calculated using an indirect method that involved multiplying the TURP procedure rate in the general population (from the National Hospital Discharge Survey) by estimates of the proportion of TURPs resulting in a prostate cancer diagnosis (from Medicare data and the literature). TURP explained much of the observed increase in overall prostate cancer incidence between 1973 and 1986 and possibly all of it in men aged 70 years and older. However, its influence on the trend and overall magnitude of the rates diminished between 1987 and 1993. The changing role of TURP in detecting prostate cancer is attributed to changes in medical technology and screening practices. The declining influence of TURP on prostate cancer incidence is likely to have continued beyond the study period due to the recent introduction and increasing use of medications for treating obstructive uropathy.}

The primary sources of data for our risk assessment were two long-term oncogenicity studies in male Fischer rats conducted to assess the potential pathogenic effects associated with prolonged inhalation of RCF. An interesting feature of the data was the availability of the temporal profile of fiber burden in the lungs of experimental animals. Because of this information, we were able to conduct both exposure-response and dose-response analyses. Our risk assessment was conducted within the framework of a biologically based model for carcinogenesis, the two-stage clonal expansion model, which allows for the explicit incorporation of the concepts of initiation and promotion in the analyses. We found that a model positing that RCF was an initiator had the highest likelihood. We proposed an approach based on biological considerations for the extrapolation of risk to humans. This approach requires estimation of human lung burdens for specific exposure scenarios, which we did by using an extension of a model due to Yu. Our approach acknowledges that the risk associated with exposure to RCF depends on exposure to other lung carcinogens. We present estimates of risk in two populations: (1) a population of nonsmokers and (2) an occupational cohort of steelworkers not exposed to coke oven emissions, a mixed population that includes both smokers and nonsmokers.}

DESIGN: From September 1994 the EuroSIDA study has prospectively followed non-selected HIV-infected people from 50 clinical sites in 18 European countries (n = 7331). METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare death rates between regions and to investigate the relationship between treatment usage and regional mortality rates. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival from the first CD4 lymphocyte count of {\textless} 200 x 10(6)/l or {\textless} 50 x 10(6)/l. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 21 months and there was a total of 1544 deaths. In people with a CD4+ cell count that fell below 200 or 50 x 10(6)/l those from central Europe had a better prognosis compared with those from the two other regions (P {\textless} 0.05). Patients from central Europe were more frequently exposed to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors compared with patients from other regions (P {\textless} 0.001). There was a significant difference in risk of death between regions after adjustment for baseline differences in demography, presence of AIDS and level of immunodeficiency (risk of death in central Europe was 37\% lower than that in southern Europe (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 33\% lower than in northern Europe (P {\textless} 0.0001)). After adjustment for use of individual antiretroviral agents, intensity of treatment regimen, CD4 lymphocyte count, weight, haemoglobin and development of AIDS as time-dependent covariates, the differences became much smaller (risk in central Europe 13\% lower than that in southern Europe (P = 0.071) and 15\% lower than in northern Europe (P = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Antiretroviral therapy has been used more aggressively in Europe in recent years, resulting in improved prognosis. In this study we observed that the HIV mortality rate in central Europe was significantly lower than those in northern and southern Europe in the period 1994 to early 1999. This finding appears to be due to the effect on survival of different treatment policies and drug availability in the three regions of Europe during this time period, with central European countries, on average, having introduced more aggressive treatment strategies earlier},

Many of these reports, however, have been based on small populations and have used different forms of statistical analysis. Our objective was to analyse systematically to what degree the epidemic of melanoma mortality had evolved similarly in different populations and whether there were any divergent trends that might increase our understanding. Instead of using all available data, we focused on countries with a minimum time series of 30 years and a minimum of 100 deaths annually in at least one sex from melanoma. We first inspected sex-specific age-standardized mortality rates and then performed age-period-cohort modelling. We found that the increase in mortality observed after 1950 was more pronounced in the age group 60-79. Statistical modelling showed a general increase in mortality rates in generations born after the turn of the century. Downturns in mortality, essentially in women and starting with generations born just before World War II, were found in Australia (where the earliest decreases were noted), the Nordic countries and the USA. Small decreases in rates in more recent generations were found in the UK and Canada. However, in France, Italy and Czechoslovakia, mortality rates were seen to be still increasing in recent cohorts. Our analysis suggests that populations are at different places on the melanoma mortality epidemic curve. The three trend patterns we observed are in agreement with time differences between populations with respect to the promotion of sun protection and the surveillance of pigmented skin lesions.}

The incidence of both lung cancer and asbestosis was greatest in those subjects with the highest levels of exposure to crocidolite and in ex-smokers.

METHODS: Recent incidence rates observed by Italian population-based cancer registries were extracted from the data base of the Italian Association of Cancer Registries. Regional estimates of incidence rates for the same cancers were obtained by the MIAMOD method. Observed and estimated crude incidence rates and incidence trends were compared for the period of diagnosis 1985-2000. Eight Italian cancer registries and seven regions were selected for the analysis since they had incidence data available during the entire selected period. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: An excellent agreement between estimated and observed crude incidence rates was found for all single cancer sites, regarding absolute incidence levels and time trends. A partial exception was breast, where empirical data showed a sudden increase in the last three years of observation, perhaps due to organized screenings in some Italian regions, and not captured by statistical models. Substantial underestimation of model-based incidence rates was found for all cancers combined, where the difference tended to increase with calendar year, up to a maximum of 20\% in recent years. The greatest part of the discrepancy can be attributed to multiple cancers, which were included in cancer registries statistics but were not accounted for in MIAMOD estimates.}

The association between demographic factors, sexually transmissible diseases, HIV-related opportunistic infections, anti-viral therapy, duration of immune deficiency and indices of immune stimulation and risk of NHL were derived for these groups. RESULTS: In a multivariate model, there were two independent groups of predictors of NHL risk. The first was duration of immunodeficiency, as measured by longer time since seroconversion (P for trend 0.008), and lower CD4 positive cell count 1 year prior to the time of NHL diagnosis (P for trend 0.009). The second predictor was B-cell stimulation, as indicated by higher serum globulin (a surrogate marker for serum immunoglobulin, P for trend 0.044) and HIV p24 antigenaemia [odds ratio (OR) for p24 positivity, 1.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-2.88]. Indices of B-cell stimulation preceded the diagnosis of NHL by several years. Factors not related to NHL risk included clinical indices of Epstein- Barr virus infection and receipt of individual nucleoside analogue antiretroviral agents. Combination therapy with these agents was associated with a non-significant reduction in NHL risk (OR, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.39-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: Markers of long-standing immune deficiency and B-cell stimulation were associated with an increased risk of developing NHL. Unless the strongest risk factor for NHL, immune deficiency, can be reversed, NHL is likely to become proportionately more important as a cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection},

Individual patient data were collected for all European and North American studies in which cytology was routinely performed and HPV testing was included as an additional parallel test. More than 60,000 women were included. The sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing were compared with routine cytology, both overall and for ages {\textless}35, 35-49 and 50+. The age-specific prevalence of high risk HPV (hr-HPV) was also analysed. HPV testing was substantially more sensitive in detecting CIN2+ than cytology (96.1\% vs. 53.0\%) but less specific (90.7\% vs. 96.3\%). The sensitivity of HPV testing was similar in all studies carried out in different areas of Europe and North America, whereas the sensitivity of cytology was highly variable. HPV sensitivity was uniformly high at all ages, whereas the sensitivity of cytology was substantially better in women over the age of 50 than in younger women (79.3\% vs. 59.6\%). The specificity of both tests increased with age. Positivity rates for HPV testing in women without high-grade CIN were region dependent. These results support the use of HPV testing as the sole primary screening test, with cytology reserved for women who test HPV positive. Large demonstration projects are needed to fully evaluate this strategy.}

There is, however, a tradeoff between up-to-dateness and precision of period survival estimates: increasing up-to-dateness by restricting the analysis to a relatively short period, such as the most recent calendar year, goes along with loss of precision. Recently, a model-based approach was proposed, in which more precise period survival estimates for the most recent year can be obtained through modeling of survival trends within a recent 5-year period. We assess possibilities to extend the time window used for modeling to come up with even more precise, but equally accurate and up-to-date estimates of prognosis. Empirical evaluation using data from the Finnish Cancer Registry shows that extension of the time window to about 10 years provides, in most cases, as accurate results as using a 5-year time window (whereas further extension may lead to considerably less accurate results in some cases). Using 10-year time windows for modeling, SEs of survival estimates can be approximately halved compared with conventional period survival estimates for the most recent calendar year. Furthermore, we present a modification of the modeling approach, which allows extension to 10-year time windows to be achieved without the need to include additional cohorts of patients diagnosed longer time ago and which provides similarly accurate survival estimates at comparable levels of precision in most cases. Our analyses indicate opportunities to further maximize benefits of model-based period analysis of cancer survival.}

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PSA screening, with and without adjustment for quality of life, for the British Columbia (BC) population. We adapted an existing natural history model using BC incidence, treatment, cost and mortality patterns. The modeled mortality benefit of screening derives from a stage-shift mechanism, assuming mortality reduction consistent with the European Study of Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer. The model projected outcomes for 40-year-old men under 14 combinations of screening ages and frequencies. Cost and utility estimates were explored with deterministic sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness of regular screening ranged from \$36,300/LYG, for screening every four years from ages 55 to 69 years, to \$588,300/LYG, for screening every two years from ages 40 to 74 years. The marginal benefits of increasing screening frequency to 2 years or starting screening at age 40 years were small and came at significant cost. After utility adjustment, all screening strategies resulted in a loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); however, this result was very sensitive to utility estimates. Plausible outcomes under a range of screening strategies inform discussion of prostate cancer screening policy in BC and similar jurisdictions. Screening may be cost-effective, but the sensitivity of results to utility values suggests individual preferences for quality versus quantity of life should be a key consideration.},

This review attempts to place the debate in the proper context for establishing causation. Relevant epidemiologic and pathologic studies are analyzed, as well as the scientific basis for each position in the debate. The assertion that asbestosis must be present in order to attribute a lung cancer to asbestos exposure does not meet accepted standards for establishing causation. In addition, some evidence has been incorrectly cited in support of this position. This discussion can benefit from clearer definitions of asbestosis, a more thorough evaluation of the available scientific information, and a proper context for determining causation. This review of the available evidence indicates that lung cancers can occur as a result of asbestos exposure, in the absence of clinical or histologic asbestosis. Causation in an individual should be assessed by considering duration of exposure, intensity of exposure, and appropriate latency.}

	abstract = {Disease screening is a fundamental part of health care. To evaluate the accuracy of a new screening modality, ideally the results of the screening test are compared with those of a definitive diagnostic test in a set of study subjects. However, definitive diagnostic tests are often invasive and cannot be applied to subjects whose screening tests are negative for disease. For example, in cancer screening, the assessment of true disease status requires a biopsy sample, which for ethical reasons can only be obtained if a subject's screening test indicates presence of cancer. Although the absolute accuracy of screening tests cannot be evaluated in such circumstances, it is possible to compare the accuracies of screening tests. Specifically, using relative true positive rate (the ratio of the true positive rate of one test to another) and relative false positive rate (the ratio of the false positive rates of two tests) as measures of relative accuracy, we show that inference about relative accuracy can be made from such studies. Analogies with case-control studies can be drawn where inference about absolute risk cannot be made, but inference about relative risk can. In this paper, we develop a marginal regression analysis framework for making inference about relative accuracy when only screen positives are followed for true disease. In this context factors influencing the relative accuracies of tests can be evaluated. It is important to determine such factors in order to understand circumstances in which one test is preferable to another. The methods are applied to two cancer screening studies, one concerning the effect of race on screening for prostate cancer and the other concerning the effect of tumour grade on the detection of cervical cancer with cytology versus cervicography screening.},

Ninety-nine of the donor-recipient pairs were mismatched for a serologically defined HLA-DR antigen while 109 pairs were mismatched for the HLA-DR region by HTC typing. Donor antirecipient relative responses (RR) in MLC, corresponding to the GvHD vector in marrow transplantation, ranged from -4\% to 100\%, with a median of 25\%. A comparison of reactivity in MLC with presence or absence of matching by Dw phenotyping, however, showed a significant overlap in the distribution of RRs from HLA-Dw matched versus Dw mismatched pairs, suggesting that the MLC was not a reliable predictor of HLA-Dw matching. Using an optimally-defined cutoff of 3\% RR, the MLC was correlated with risk of developing clinically significant grades II-IV acute GvHD (p = 0.03) but not with risk of developing severe grades III-IV GvHD (p = 0.18). In contrast, matching by Dw phenotype was a significant predictor of GvHD, with Dw-compatible transplant recipients less likely to develop either grades II-IV (p = 0.004) or III-IV (p = 0.036) GvHD than Dw-incompatible transplant recipients. Overall, these results underscore the difficulty in using the MLC to measure HLA-D region compatibility and predict the risk of severe graft-versus-host disease among patients receiving related haploidentical marrow grafts. HLA-D (HTC) typing results correlate primarily with DRB compatibility, and with the advent of DRB1 allele matching by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) or by direct sequencing, the precision in donor matching achievable with these methods is far greater than with either HLA-D typing or direct MLC testing.}

SUBJECTS: Data from 57 men and 26 women, aged 28-72 years, living in Western Australia. METHODS: The FFQ was administered at baseline (FFQ1) and repeated 1 year later (FFQ2). Four 1-week diet records (DRs) were completed during the year. RESULTS: Mean agreement between FFQ2 and FFQ1 was 120\% for BC and 98\% for retinol. LOA were 47-306\% and 21-459\%, respectively. Mean agreement between FFQ2 and the DR was 149\% for BC and 63\% for retinol; LOA were 50-447\% and 11-349\%, respectively. Mean agreement and LOA varied across energy intakes. Between the DR and FFQ2, correlation coefficients were 0.36 for BC and 0.51 for retinol. These varied considerably across age, gender and energy intakes and were not in accordance with limits of agreement findings. CONCLUSION: Although correlation coefficients were positive and significant, there was less than ideal intra-method and inter-method reliability shown by the limits of agreement method. Bias was uneven across the range of intakes, the LOA were wide and, compared with the DR, the FFQ significantly over-estimated BC and under-estimated retinol. This shows the limitations of calculating correlation coefficients alone, for assessing reliability and validity.}

Cancer mortality rates for the period 1965-1994 in Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovakia (analysed together), Hungary, Poland, and Romania were analysed for cancers of the larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreas. Using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated smoothed observed rates. The effects of period and cohort were extrapolated to estimate mortality projections for 1995-99, 2004-09, and 2005-09. Mortality rates for all sites are projected to increase in most countries. Hungary has the highest projected rates for most sites, and particularly rapid increases are expected for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and of the larynx in Hungarian men. The smoothed 1990-94 male mortality rates for these two sites of 16. 32/100,000 and 8.70/100,000, respectively, are projected to reach 35. 17/100,000 for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx and 14.12/100, 000 for cancer of the larynx by the period 2000-04. For kidney cancer, former Czechoslovakia has the highest observed and projected mortality rates. The smoothed 1990-94 rate of 8.37/100,000 is expected to increase 24\% to 10.38/100,000 by 2000-04. Our results indicate that further increases may be expected on top of the already high cancer mortality levels in Central Europe. Policies to reduce alcohol consumption and prevent smoking in younger generations are necessary to reduce mortality as these cohorts age.}

METHODS: Cancer prevalence by phase of care was estimated from colorectal cancer incidence and survival from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, population estimates and projections from the US Census Bureau, and all cause mortality data from the Human Mortality Life Tables. Assumptions of constant incidence and survival were used for projections from 2000 to 2020. Modeled and directly observed patient months by phase of care were compared for 1996 -1998 to provide validation of estimates. RESULTS: Prevalence of colorectal cancer is estimated to increase from 1,002,786 (0.36\%) patients to 1,522,348 (0.46\%) patients between 2000 and 2020. The estimated number of person-months in the initial and last year of life phases of care will increase 43\%, while the monitoring phase of care will increase 54\%. Modeled person-months by phase of care were consistent with directly observed measures of person months by phase of care in 1996-1998. CONCLUSIONS: Under assumptions of current cancer control strategies we project that colorectal cancer prevalence will increase more rapidly than the US population, largely due to the aging of the US population. This suggests that considerable resources will be needed in the future for initial, continuing and last year of life treatment of colorectal cancer patients unless notable breakthroughs in primary prevention occur in the future years.}

	annote = {The potent and specific lytic activity of CTLs can occur by at least two distinct pathways. In the secretion and perforin-mediated pathway, the direct effect(s) on the target cell membrane of the pore-forming agent perforin, probably in conjunction with granzymes, also secreted from the CTLs, causes the target's demise. Intercytoplasmic transfer of granzymes is believed to be involved in inducing target apoptosis. In the Fas-mediated pathway, engagement of a CTL membrane ligand with an apoptosis-inducing target cell surface receptor, such as the FasL with Fas, triggers programmed disintegration of the CTL-bound target; secretion of granzymes and pore formation by perforin are not involved in this receptor-mediated mechanism. Despite the fundamental differences in their onset for both pathways, the downstream sequence of events that culminate in target cell apoptosis appears to be similar. Further studies will resolve this enigma.}

We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.}

	annote = {Ensemble prediction systems typically show positive spread-error correlation, but they are subject to forecast bias and dispersion errors, and are therefore uncalibrated. This work proposes the use of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), an easy-to-implement postprocessing technique that addresses both forecast bias and underdispersion and takes into account the spread-skill relationship. The technique is based on multiple linear regression and is akin to the superensemble approach that has traditionally been used for deterministic-style forecasts. The EMOS technique yields probabilistic forecasts that take the form of Gaussian predictive probability density functions (PDFs) for continuous weather variables and can be applied to gridded model output. The EMOS predictive mean is a bias-corrected weighted average of the ensemble member forecasts, with coefficients that can be interpreted in terms of the relative contributions of the member models to the ensemble, and provides a highly competitive deterministic-style forecast. The EMOS predictive variance is a linear function of the ensemble variance. For fitting the EMOS coefficients, the method of minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation is introduced. This technique finds the coefficient values that optimize the CRPS for the training data. The EMOS technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of sea level pressure and surface temperature over the North American Pacific Northwest in spring 2000, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. When compared to the bias-corrected ensemble, deterministic-style EMOS forecasts of sea level pressure had root-mean-square error 9\% less and mean absolute error 7\% less. The EMOS predictive PDFs were sharp, and much better calibrated than the raw ensemble or the bias-corrected ensemble.}

METHODS: Breast cancer mortality was compared between women who were invited to service screening at ages 40 to 49 years (study group) and women in the same age group who were not invited during 1986 to 2005 (control group). Together, these women comprise the Mammography Screening of Young Women (SCRY) cohort, which includes all Swedish counties. A prescreening period was defined to facilitate a comparison of mortality in the absence of screening. The outcome measure was refined mortality, ie, breast cancer death for women who were diagnosed during follow-up at ages 40 to 49 years. Relative risks (RRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in breast cancer mortality during the prescreening period. During the study period, there were 803 breast cancer deaths in the study group (7.3 million person-years) and 1238 breast cancer deaths in the control group (8.8 million person-years). The average follow-up was 16 years. The estimated RR for women who were invited to screening was 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.83), and the RR for women who attended screening was 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.62-0.80). CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive study, mammography screening for women ages 40 to 49 years was efficient for reducing breast cancer mortality.},

A recent upturn in these trends suggests that one component may be the effect of more aggressive screening in the population. The age-period-cohort framework, in which the temporal components associated with year of diagnosis and generation are evaluated, can assist in interpreting the elements associated with these trends. A unique approach for exploring other ways of partitioning the contribution of the different temporal components is described and applied to breast cancer incidence data (ICDO 174.0-174.9) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries. Single-year intervals for age and year of diagnosis were used to fit models that provide estimates of the trends associated with the individual temporal elements. A log-linear model for age, period, and cohort was fitted using Poisson regression, and estimates of the separate time trends were calculated. The trends with period increased after 1982, when more aggressive screening began, and the trend is steeper for women older than 40 years. Cohort trends have increased steadily, although recent cohorts appear to be somewhat flat for women aged 50 years or younger, whereas the trend for those older than 50 years have continued to increase. Estimates of cohort trends in rates are also provided by extrapolating what would have occurred had there been no period trend before or after 1982, thus providing an estimate of the magnitude of the upturn that occurred after the recent emphasis on screening.}

However, application of this method has so far been hindered by the lack of pertinent computer programs. In this paper, we present a simple and easy-to-use computer program (SAS macro) that enables one to carry out period analysis (as well as conventional analysis) of both absolute and relative survival rates with the type of data commonly available in population-based cancer registries. We illustrate application of the program with examples from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry.}

An exception could be the association between NAT2 slow acetylation, GSTM1 null genotype, and bladder-cancer risk. However, current evidence is based on meta-analyses of relatively small studies (range 23-374 cases) with some evidence of publication bias and study heterogeneity. Associations between polymorphisms in other NAT and GST genes and bladder-cancer risk have been inconsistent. METHODS: We investigated polymorphisms in NAT2, GSTM1, NAT1, GSTT1, GSTM3, and GSTP1 in 1150 patients with transitional-cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and 1149 controls in Spain; all the participants were white. We also carried out meta-analyses of NAT2, GSTM1, and bladder cancer that included more than twice as many cases as in previous reports. FINDINGS: In our study, the odds ratios for bladder cancer for individuals with deletion of one or two copies of the GSTM1 gene were 1.2 (95\% CI 0.8-1.7) and 1.9 (1.4-2.7) respectively (p for trend {\textless}0.0001). Compared with NAT2 rapid or intermediate acetylators, NAT2 slow acetylators had an increased overall risk of bladder cancer (1.4 [1.2-1.7]) that was stronger for cigarette smokers than for never smokers (p for interaction 0.008). No significant associations were found with the other polymorphisms. Meta-analyses showed that the overall association for NAT2 was robust (p{\textless}0.0001), and case-only meta-analyses provided support for an interaction between NAT2 and smoking (p for interaction 0.009). The overall association for GSTM1 was also robust (p{\textless}0.0001) and was not modified by smoking status (p=0.86). INTERPRETATION: The GSTM1 null genotype increases the overall risk of bladder cancer, and the NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype increases risk particularly among cigarette smokers. These findings provide compelling evidence for the role of common polymorphisms in the aetiology of cancer. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: Although the relative risks are modest, these polymorphisms could account for up to 31\% of bladder cancers because of their high prevalence.}

FINDINGS: 37 (84\%) of 44 patients with mesothelioma had raised concentrations of SMR at a serum dilution of 1/80, compared with three (2\%) of 160 patients with other cancers or other inflammatory lung or pleural diseases, and with none of 28 controls who had not been exposed to asbestos. SMR concentrations correlated with tumour size and increased during tumour progression. Seven of the 40 asbestos-exposed individuals had increased serum concentrations of SMR; three of those seven developed mesothelioma and one developed lung carcinoma within 1-5 years. None of the 33 asbestos-exposed participants whose serum samples had normal concentrations of SMR and who were followed up over 8 years developed mesothelioma. INTERPRETATION: Determination of SMR in serum could be a useful marker for diagnosis of mesothelioma and to monitor disease progression. It might also prove helpful for screening asbestos-exposed individuals for early evidence of mesothelioma.}

Several polymorphisms within the IGF-I and IGFBP-3 coding regions have been associated with increased serum protein levels. METHODS: To ascertain the potential relationship between serum levels and polymorphism, and prostate cancer risk, we investigated the role of two polymorphisms the IGF-I cytosine-adenosine (CA)-repeat and the IGFBP-3 Ala32Gly, and prostate cancer in a population-based, case-control, study of middle-aged men. RESULTS: We found no significant association between the IGFBP-3 Ala32Gly polymorphism and prostate cancer risk, even though the presence of at least one Gly allele did correlate with increased serum levels of IGFBP-3. For IGF-I, more controls (42\%) than cases (38\%) were homozygous for 19-CA-repeats (odds ratio, OR = 0.85; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-1.09). After stratifying by disease characteristics, 19-CA-repeat homozygous men displayed a decreased risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.50; 95\% CI = 0.27-0.93), but no associations were observed with more aggressive features of disease. Additionally, there was no correlation between mean serum IGF-I protein levels and IGF-I genotype in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Further evaluation of the IGF-I CA-repeat polymorphism and prostate cancer is necessary to determine if the modest risk reduction associated with the 19-CA-repeat homozygous state is observed in other study populations.}

Baseline factors that were investigated as predictors of virological failure were plasma HIV-1 RNA, the number and type of new antiretroviral drugs in the regimen, and viral susceptibility to the drugs in the regimen, determined by genotyping or phenotyping methods. These analyses confirmed the importance of both genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance as predictors of virological failure, whether these factors were analysed separately or adjusted for other baseline confounding factors. In most of the re-analysed studies, the odds of virological failure were reduced by about twofold for each additional drug in the regimen to which the patient's virus was sensitive by genotyping methods, and by about two- to threefold for each additional drug that was sensitive by phenotyping},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information on the cause of diagnosis, tumour characteristics and primary treatment for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1999 and December 2007 was extracted from the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden. This register includes data for 95\% of Swedish prostate cancer cases. RESULTS: The total age-standardized annual incidence of prostate cancer per 100,000 men increased from 187 in 1999 to 233 in 2004, but decreased thereafter to 196 in 2007. The incidence of asymptomatic cases also peaked in 2004 (at 62 per 100,000 men), but varied six-fold between different counties in that year (16-98 per 100,000 men). Asymptomatic cases (n = 17,143) constituted 15\% of all new cases in 2000 and 30\% in 2007. Almost as many cases were diagnosed in stage T1c in men with symptoms, usually from the lower urinary tract. Together these two groups constituted 29\% of all new cases in 2000 and 52\% in 2007. It was estimated that at least one-third of all Swedish men aged 50-75 years had a PSA test between 2000 and 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Even though screening for prostate cancer is not recommended in Sweden, PSA testing of men without clinical signs of prostate cancer is common. The effects on the Swedish incidence of prostate cancer were similar to those reported from the USA.}

To help determine whether smoking is a cofactor for the development of liver cancer, we ascertained retrospectively the smoking habits of 36,000 adults who had died from liver cancer (cases) and 17,000 who had died from cirrhosis (controls) in 24 Chinese cities and 74 rural counties. Calculations of the smoker vs. nonsmoker risk ratios (RR) for liver cancer mortality were standardised for age and locality. Among adult men (aged 35+) there was a 36\% excess risk of death from liver cancer among smokers (smoker vs. nonsmoker standardised risk ratio [RR] =1.36, with 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.43, 2p{\textless}0.00001; attributable fraction 18\%). In the general male population this indicates absolute risks of death from liver cancer before age 70 of about 4\% in smokers and 3\% in nonsmokers (in the absence of other causes). Most liver cancer, however, occurs among the 10-12\% of men with haematological evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection, so among them the corresponding risks would be about 33\% in smokers and 25\% in nonsmokers. The RR was approximately independent of age, was similar in urban and rural areas, was not significantly related to the age when smoking started but was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) greater for cigarette smokers than for smokers of other forms of tobacco. Among men who smoked only cigarettes, the RR was significantly (p{\textless}0.001 for trend) related to daily consumption, with a greater hazard among those who smoked 20/day (RR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.39-1.62) than among those who smoked fewer (mean 10/day: RR=1.32, 95\% CI 1.23-1.41). Smoking was also associated with a significant excess of liver cancer death in women (RR 1.17, 95\% CI 1.06-1.29, 2p=0.003; attributable fraction 3\%), but fewer women (17\%) than men (62\%) were smokers, and their cigarette consumption per smoker was lower. Among women who smoked only cigarettes, there was a significantly greater hazard among those who smoked at least 20/day (mean 22/day: RR=1.45, 95\% CI 1.18-1.79) than among those who smoked fewer (mean 8/day: RR=1.09, 95\% CI 0.94-1.25). These associations indicate that tobacco is currently responsible for about 50,000 liver cancer deaths each year in China, chiefly among men with chronic HBV infection.}

The behaviour of interest is parent/infant co-sleeping. This paper reports parent/infant co-sleeping arrangements of different ethnic groups in New Zealand. METHODS: A stratified random sample of 6268 infants attending Plunket clinics for their three and six-month visits was taken over the years 1995-1996. Maori and Pacific infants were oversampled. Parents who shared a bed with their infant were asked how they arranged the babies sleeping place according to pre-coded diagrams. Routine parent/infant co-sleeping was defined as "bed sharing at least four nights over the last two weeks". RESULTS: There were 2693 infants who shared the bed with their sleeping parents during at least one of the previous 14 nights. Of these infants, 1060 routinely shared the parents' bed. At three months, 56\% of routinely co-sleeping infants slept directly in the bed, 29\% slept in a raised position, 3\% slept in a carrycot or basket, and 5\% in other positions. At six months, 60\% of the routinely co-sleeping infants slept directly in the bed with their parents, 23\% slept in a raised position, 1\% slept in a carrycot or basket, and 7\% in other positions. There were significant differences in the co-sleeping locations by ethnicity. CONCLUSION: There is still some ongoing dispute as to whether parent/infant co-sleeping is a risk factor for SIDS. This study has identified differences in the way infants co-sleep with their parents and this can be used to clarify infant care practices in relation to SIDS.}

Evidence that exposure to aircraft noise is associated with higher psychiatric hospital admission rates is mixed. Some evidence exists of an association between aircraft noise exposure and use of psychotropic medications. People with a pre-existing psychological or psychiatric condition may be more susceptible to the effects or exposure to aircraft noise. Aircraft noise can produce effects on electroencephalogram sleep patterns and cause wakefulness and difficult in sleeping. Attendances at general practitioners, self-reported health problems and use of medications, have been associated with exposure to aircraft noise, but some findings are inconsistent. Some association between aircraft noise exposure and elevated mean blood pressure has been observed in cross-sectional studies of schoolchildren, but with little confirmation from cohort studies. There is no convincing evidence to suggest that all-cause or cause-specific mortality is increased by exposure to aircraft noise. There is no strong evidence that aircraft noise has significant perinatal effects. Using the World Health Organization definition of health, which includes positive mental and social wellbeing, aircraft noise is responsible for considerable ill-health. However, population-based studies have not found strong evidence that people living near or under aircraft flight paths suffer higher rates of clinical morbidity or mortality as a consequence of exposure to aircraft noise. A dearth of high quality studies in this area precludes drawing substantive conclusions.}

Low participation carries the risk of terminating studies early and making them invalid owing to insufficient statistical power. This study investigated patients' and clinicians' experiences of randomization with the aim of facilitating trial participation in the future. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a qualitative study using content analysis. Patients offered to participate in a randomized trial and randomizing clinicians were interviewed. Five participants, four non-participants and five randomizing clinicians were interviewed, 2-8 years from randomization. RESULTS: Clinicians used strategies in interaction with the patients to facilitate decision making. Patients' attitudes differed and experiences of relatives or friends were often stated as reasons for treatment preferences. Patients described that letting chance decide treatment was a difficult barrier to overcome for randomization. The clinicians used a number of different strategies perceived to make randomization more acceptable to their patients. The clinicians' own motivation for randomizing patients for trials depended on the medical relevance of the study question and the clinicians' major obstacle was to maintain equipoise over time. Regular meetings with the study group helped to maintain equipoise and motivation. CONCLUSIONS: To establish a good platform for randomization the clinician needs to know about the patient's treatment preferences and the patient's attitude concerning the role of the clinician to facilitate decision making. The strategies used by the clinicians were perceived as helpful and could be tested in an intervention study.}

The methodology uses only information which should be routinely available in the course of a typical screening program, and makes only rather mild statistical assumptions. The authors illustrate the methods with breast cancer screening data from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP). Although these data have been analyzed by several other authors, the present approach is the first which simultaneously gives estimates of the pre-clinical state duration, the sensitivity of the screening method, and the underlying incidence rate in the screened group, while also taking into account the problem of length-biased sampling.}

	annote = {We present a general framework for sample size calculation in survival studies based on comparing two or more survival distributions using any one of a class of tests including the logrank test. Incorporated within this framework are the possible presence of non-uniform staggered patient entry, non-proportional hazards, loss to follow-up and treatment changes including cross-over between treatment arms. The framework is very general in nature and is based on using piecewise exponential distributions to model the survival distributions. We illustrate the use of the approach and explore its validity using simulation studies. These studies have shown that not adjusting for loss to follow-up, non-proportional hazards or cross-over can lead to significant alterations in power or equivalently, a marked effect on sample size. The approach has been implemented in the freely available program ART (for Stata). Our investigations suggest that ART is the first software to allow incorporation of all these elements. Further extensions to the methodology such as non-local alternatives for the logrank test are also considered.}

Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), the ratios of the observed to the expected numbers of incident bladder cancers, were used to calculate the risk associated with BPH. The expected number was calculated by multiplying the number of person-years by the age-specific cancer incidence rates in Sweden for each 5-year age group and calendar year of observation. Analyses were stratified by BPH treatment, latency, calendar year and presence of genitourinary (GU) comorbid conditions. After excluding the first 3 years of follow-up after the index hospitalisation, we observed 506 incident bladder cancer cases during follow-up in the cohort. No overall increased risk of bladder cancer was apparent in our main analysis involving the entire BPH cohort. However, among BPH patients with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), there was an increased risk in all follow-up periods; SIRs of bladder cancer during years 4-6 of follow-up was 1.22 (95\% confidence interval=1.02-1.46), 1.32 for 7-9 years of follow-up, and 1.47 for 10-26 years of follow-up. SIRs of bladder cancer among TURP-treated BPH patients were particularly elevated among those with comorbid conditions of the GU tract (e.g., stone, infection, etc.); 1.72, 1.74 and 2.01 for 4-6, 7-9, 10-26 years of follow-up, respectively, and also for those whose diagnoses occurred before 1975, when TURP was more likely to be performed by a urologist than a general practitioner: 1.87, 1.90 and 1.74, respectively. These findings suggest that BPH overall is not associated with bladder cancer risk. However, among men treated with TURP, particularly those with other comorbid GU tract conditions, risk of bladder cancer was elevated.}

In addition, risk factors such as hormone replacement therapy use have been changing contemporaneously with the introduction of screening. Although we do not indicate exactly how such complexities should be corrected for, we use some simple informal adjustments to show how they may account for a substantial proportion of increased incidence, which might otherwise erroneously have been attributed to overdiagnosis. We illustrate this using an example of analysis of breast cancer incidence data from Sweden.}

The main components of these screening programmes are: (i) their level of organisation; (ii) the age at which women begin screening; (iii) the age at which women discontinue screening; (iv) the interval between repeat screens; (v) the frequency at which the programmes provide screening; and (vi) the response to an abnormal screening test. However, not all screening programmes are equally efficient and differences in programme components can result in big differences in their cost effectiveness. Studies that employ cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to examine the efficiency of different programme components can inform the development of cost-effective programmes. This article presents findings of an international review of cost-effectiveness studies of cervical cancer screening. These studies consistently find that certain types of programmes are more cost effective than others. Programmes that are centrally organised and implemented by the public sector are reported to be more cost effective than those that use public funds for screening at other medical visits (convenience screening), or those that provide guidelines for healthcare professionals and the public to promote spontaneous discretionary screening. There is also substantial agreement about the cost effectiveness of other programme components. When multiple screenings are possible, studies report that they should generally begin at age 25 to 35 years and end at age 65 to 70 years, although it is important that older women have 3 normal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears before the discontinuation of screening. The interval for repeat screens that is reported to provide the best balance between cost and life-years saved is between 3 and 5 years. However, when a choice must be made between screening more women fewer times, or screening fewer women more times, most studies indicate that it is more cost effective to prioritize resources to obtain at least one screening for each woman. The screening of previously unscreened and high-risk populations has been shown to be especially cost effective. Despite this agreement, many studies report that models of the cost effectiveness of screening for cervical cancer are sensitive to a number of parameters. Changes in the attendance rate of the programme, the quality of the Pap smear, and the cost of the Pap smear can markedly change the cost effectiveness of a screening programme. Finally, this review discusses different perspectives of social choice analysis (e.g. CEA and cost-benefit analysis), when the objective is to prevent cervical cancer and the options are to screen, detect and treat, to reduce behavioural risk factors, and/or to pursue promising biological research.}

These intervals include the uncertainty of the parameter estimates and variations in future rates but do not include the uncertainty of assumptions, such as continuation of current trends. In this study we evaluated whether prediction intervals are useful in practice. METHODS: Rates for the period 1993-97 were predicted from cancer incidence rates in the five Nordic countries for the period 1958-87. In a Poisson regression model, 95\% prediction intervals were constructed for 200 combinations of 20 cancer types for males and females in the five countries. The coverage level was calculated as the proportion of the prediction intervals that covered the observed number of cases in 1993-97. RESULTS: Overall, 52\% (104/200) of the prediction intervals covered the observed numbers. When the prediction intervals were divided into quartiles according to the number of cases in the last observed period, the coverage level was inversely proportional to the frequency (84\%, 52\%, 46\% and 26\%). The coverage level varied widely among the five countries, but the difference declined after adjustment for the number of cases in each country. CONCLUSION: The coverage level of prediction intervals strongly depended on the number of cases on which the predictions were based. As the sample size increased, uncertainty about the adequacy of the model dominated, and the coverage level fell far below 95\%. Prediction intervals for cancer incidence must therefore be interpreted with caution.}

Thirteen of them had an acute symptomatic primary infection, eight subjects had asymptomatic primary infection and long-term follow-up, and 27 had asymptomatic seroconversion and short-term follow-up. Quantitative plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ lymphocyte counts, and levels of antibodies to gp120, p66, p41, p31, p24, and p17 were measured. At the time of seroconversion, there was no significant difference in HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ counts between symptomatic (n = 13) and asymptomatic (n = 27) subjects. Subsequently, however, establishment of low levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA was seen significantly more frequently in asymptomatic (n = 8) than in symptomatic (n = 13) primary infection; this correlated with higher levels of some (anti-gp120 and anti-p31) anti-HIV-1 antibodies and a slower decline in CD4+ lymphocyte counts. These results indicate that immunologic control of viremia early after infection may be a critical determinant to subsequent clinical course of HIV-1 infection. They also suggest that persons with acute symptomatic primary infection may generally progress to having acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) more rapidly than people with low-grade symptoms or asymptomatic primary infection.}

The results of Papanicolaou testing were abnormal (malignant or premalignant) in 11 of 816 women screened. This early detection of cervical neoplasia saved +5907 and 3.7 years of life per 100 Papanicolaou tests. When average medical costs per year of life extended by screening were included, the program cost +2874 per year of life saved. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses performed on competing medical and economic points of view did not change the conclusion of a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio for screening. Our findings indicate that the benefits from some prevention programs for the elderly can offset the costs of these programs. More research is needed to guide public policy on prevention for selected population groups.}

The objectives of this article were to reconstruct patterns of PSA testing between black and white men in the US and to determine the extent of any racial disparity in PSA use. METHODS: Data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey were used to model the adoption of PSA and to estimate the distribution of age at first test. Longitudinal Medicare claims data were used to estimate the distribution of intervals between tests. The rates of initial and subsequent tests were then combined by simulation to reconstruct individual screening histories. Results are from the reconstructed model. RESULTS: Overall, 45\% of white men and 43\% of black men within ages 40-84 years had at least 1 PSA test by the year 2000. The authors found that among older men, whites adopted PSA screening earlier than blacks, whereas among younger men, this trend was reversed, with blacks adopting screening earlier than whites. Annual testing frequencies generated by the simulation model were higher for white men aged{\textgreater}or=60 years and higher for black men aged{\textless}60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated fairly similar patterns overall of PSA testing for blacks and whites. These similarities indicated that racial disparity in PSA testing is probably not a major factor behind current racial differences in prostate cancer mortality rates and declines. Knowledge of patterns of screening is important to an understanding of the impact of population screening on cancer incidence and mortality, but retrospective data sources have significant limitations when used to estimate these patterns of care.}

METHODS: A postal survey was carried out in a community-dwelling random sample, in Auxerre, France. LUTS were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Urinary incontinence (UI) was assessed using a score based upon four questions. RESULTS: 1216 men and 591 women participated in the survey. 19.2\% of men and 13.7\% of women reported moderate to severe LUTS (IPSS {\textgreater} 7). 73\% of men and 29\% of women suffered from UI. Among men and women reporting severe symptoms of UI (0.4 and 5.4\% respectively), one third had been prescribed medications for urinary disorders within the previous six months. CONCLUSION: This survey confirms the high prevalence of LUTS and urinary incontinence among a community-dwelling sample of men and women, and highlights the need for management of these disorders.}

In the current study, the authors examined whether African-American men and men who had a family history of prostate carcinoma underwent PSA testing preferentially, and patterns of test use were examined according to age, race, and other factors. METHODS: Data regarding self-reported PSA test use in the past year among men age 50 years and older without a history of prostate carcinoma (n = 8713 men) were analyzed from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: The overall rate of PSA use was 43.0\%. Older age, higher socioeconomic status, having a usual source of healthcare, and a family history of prostate carcinoma were the strongest predictors of testing. Higher risk African-American men age 50 years and older were no more likely to be tested than white men. Men at higher risk who had a family history of prostate carcinoma were more likely to have been tested than men who had no such family history. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PSA use among higher risk men who had a family history of prostate carcinoma were higher compared with the rates among men without such a family history. However, PSA testing rates among higher risk African-American men were no different than the rates among lower risk white men, suggesting that some risk factors for prostate carcinoma (but not others) are associated with preferential testing. Testing in all groups was associated with access to care variables, highlighting the importance of removing barriers to preventive healthcare services.}

The CI5 I-IX database brings together the results from all nine volumes, spanning a period of some 50 years. In addition, unpublished annual data, with more diagnostic detail, are made available for many cancer registries with 15 or more years of recent data. We describe the construction and composition of the CI5 databases, and provide examples of how they can be used to prepare tables and graphs comparing incidence rates between populations. This is the classical role of descriptive statistics: to allow formulation of hypotheses that might explain the observed differences (geographically, over time, in population subgroups) and that can be tested by further study. Such statistics are also essential components in the planning and evaluation of cancer control programmes.}

Cancer prevalence statistics have generally been provided by a limited number of well established cancer registries that have been in existence for several decades. The advent of systematic follow-up of life status of incident cases and the availability of new statistical methodologies, now makes it possible for registries established during the 1970s or 1980s to provide prevalence data. The main problems encountered in the estimation of prevalence are the inclusion of: (i) cases lost to follow-up; (ii) cases known only from their death certificate; (iii) cases diagnosed before the start of registration; and (iv) the treatment of multiple tumours and migrations. The main aim of this paper was to review these problems and discuss, through the experience gained with EUROPREVAL, how they can be overcome. A method is presented for the calculation of prevalence of all cancers combined in the populations covered by the 45 cancer registries participating in EUROPREVAL. Prevalence of cancer is estimated to be 2\% on average, with the highest values (3\%) in Sweden and the lowest in Eastern Europe, with a minimum of approximately 1\% in Poland.}

Finasteride, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase, inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the primary androgen in the prostate, and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer. METHODS: In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, we randomly assigned 18,882 men 55 years of age or older with a normal digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 3.0 ng per milliliter or lower to treatment with finasteride (5 mg per day) or placebo for seven years. Prostate biopsy was recommended if the annual PSA level, adjusted for the effect of finasteride, exceeded 4.0 ng per milliliter or if the digital rectal examination was abnormal. It was anticipated that 60 percent of participants would have prostate cancer diagnosed during the study or would undergo biopsy at the end of the study. The primary end point was the prevalence of prostate cancer during the seven years of the study. RESULTS: Prostate cancer was detected in 803 of the 4368 men in the finasteride group who had data for the final analysis (18.4 percent) and 1147 of the 4692 men in the placebo group who had such data (24.4 percent), for a 24.8 percent reduction in prevalence over the seven-year period (95 percent confidence interval, 18.6 to 30.6 percent; P{\textless}0.001). Tumors of Gleason grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 were more common in the finasteride group (280 of 757 tumors [37.0 percent], or 6.4 percent of the 4368 men included in the final analysis) than in the placebo group (237 of 1068 tumors [22.2 percent], P{\textless}0.001 for the comparison between groups; or 5.1 percent of the 4692 men included in the final analysis, P=0.005 for the comparison between groups). Sexual side effects were more common in finasteride-treated men, whereas urinary symptoms were more common in men receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Finasteride prevents or delays the appearance of prostate cancer, but this possible benefit and a reduced risk of urinary problems must be weighed against sexual side effects and the increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer.},

In a case-crossover analysis, confounding by fixed (constant) characteristics is eliminated by pairing of cases to themselves, at the possible cost of introducing bias due to time trends in exposure. A case-time-control analysis can correct case-crossover results only for bias due to such time trends. If an uncontrolled confounder (such as disease severity) is present, the use of time controls can introduce new confounding, and the case-time-control results may end up either more or less confounded than the ordinary and case-crossover results. The relative confounding in the different approaches depends on details of the relations among the unmeasured confounder, the study exposure, the study disease, and any trend in these variables or their effects. Like an ordinary study, a case-time-control study must assume absence of unmeasured confounders, whether fixed or time-varying. Like a case-crossover study, it must also assume absence of carryover effects and can be more prone to misclassification bias than an ordinary study.}

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 2,249 employed workers aged 40-44 years conducted in two regions in south-east Australia in 2000 used a self-completed questionnaire to collect data. Multivariate analyses were used to compare depression, anxiety, physical health and general practitioner (GP) visits over 12 months across categories of job strain and insecurity for three status groups (high, middle and low). RESULTS: High job strain and job insecurity were independently associated with poor mental health, poor physical health and visits to the GP for all status groups when adjusted for confounders. High job strain was associated with depression (OR = 2.46, 95\% CI 1.96-3.07), anxiety (OR = 2.56, 95\% Cl 2.05-3.20), lower mean physical health scores (-1.11, 95\% CI -1.98 - -0.23), and more visits to the GP (IRR = 1.20, 95\% CI 1.05-1.37). High job insecurity also showed significant associations with depression (OR = 3.03, 95\% Cl 2.03-4.53), anxiety (OR = 2.66, 95\% CI 1.81-3.91), and GP visits (IRR = 1.27, 95\% CI 1.01-1.60). There were no significant differences by status in the associations of job strain and insecurity with outcomes. CONCLUSION: High-status workers were just as likely as low-status workers to be exposed to adverse work conditions and both status groups showed similar health effects. IMPLICATIONS: Exposure to insecure and high-strain jobs is likely to rise as economies and labour markets respond to globalisation and political change. High status may not protect employees from either exposure or impact, thus widening the population health consequences of adverse work conditions.}

This paper presents a methodology to derive cancer incidence and prevalence at the regional and national scale and illustrates its application to all malignant neoplasms in Italy for the period 1970-2010. The method, denoted as MIAMOD, is based on a back-calculation approach and derives cancer-specific morbidity measures by using official mortality data and model-based relative survival from local Cancer Registries data. The output includes time-trends and projections of a complete set of epidemiological indicators, i.e. mortality, incidence and prevalence. Results for all cancers in Italy show different incidence patterns by gender and a pronounced regional variability among men: male incidence is estimated to decrease in almost all northern-central regions, while more stable or even rising trends are estimated in the southern regions. No incidence reduction is expected for women. Prevalence increases country-wide in both sexes. The proposed approach can be applied to derive regional up-to-date time trends of cancer burden indicators in countries with local and sparse cancer registration systems. These estimates are useful for planning health services on a national and regional basis and for highlighting regional differences.}

There were 13 mesotheliomas but for 10 of these there had been exposure to crocidolite whilst working on a special contract that only a small minority of the workforce were involved in. Another one had worked in an asbestos-cement factory for 20 years. This left two mesotheliomas, one unconfirmed, for which the only known exposure was to chrysotile asbestos. The second study was of a plant in Connecticut. There was a significant increase in mortality due to respiratory cancer, but this excess was greatest in those with less than 1 year's exposure and was unrelated to cumulative exposure. No mesotheliomas occurred. The third study was of two factories in Ontario manufacturing automotive components. There was a non-significant increase in lung cancer mortality but the majority of these had not worked in the departments where asbestos was used. There were two unconfirmed mesotheliomas, one of whom had worked with friction materials. In conclusion, the three studies show that, if there are any effects on mortality due to working in the manufacture of friction materials, these effects must be small.}

However, those trials demonstrated different degrees of reduction. The interpretation of observed mortality reduction after long follow-up for women aged 40-49 years at trial entry is both important and controversial. PURPOSE: We estimated what percentage of the observed mortality reduction for women aged 40-49 years at entry into the five Swedish screening trials might be attributable to screening these women at 50 years of age or older. Moreover, we calculated the most likely percentage mortality reduction for specific screening programs if the Swedish results were generalized and analyzed whether characteristics of each trial might at least partly explain the observed differences in reductions among the trials. METHODS: Each Swedish trial was simulated with one underlying computer simulation model (MISCAN--MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis) of the natural history of the disease and the performance of screening, taking into account nine important trial characteristics. Improvement in prognosis for screen-detected case patients was estimated with age-specific reduction for all trials and each trial design as a reference. RESULTS: An expected 7\% reduction in breast cancer mortality for women aged 40-49 years at trial entry (relative risk [RR] = 0.93) was determined by computer modeling, assuming no improvement in prognosis for cancers that are screen detected before 50 years of age. This result indicates that, of the overall 10\% observed reduction (RR = 0.90) in the five Swedish trials analyzed, most (70\%) of this reduction might be attributable to screening these women in later rounds after their 50th birthday. Using additional trial information, predictions of breast cancer mortality reduction in women 50 years or older might be 11\% larger than previously expected, assuming that high-quality mammographic screening can be achieved in nationwide programs. For women aged 50-69 years at trial entry, the differences in expected versus observed mortality reduction among the trials are estimated to be relatively small. (Expected mortality reductions range from 24\% to 32\%). CONCLUSIONS: Results from the Swedish randomized breast cancer-screening trials should be seen as more favorable regarding the effect of mammographic screening in reducing breast cancer mortality for women aged 50-69 years than was estimated earlier. Our analyses also suggest that the improvement in prognosis due to screening for women aged 40-49 years is much smaller than that for women aged 50 years or older. Approximately, 70\% of the 10\% observed reduction in breast cancer mortality (i.e., 7\%) for women aged 40-49 years at trial entry might be attributable to a reduction due to screening these women after they reach age 50. IMPLICATIONS: Detailed screening data for the 40- to 49-year age group of all Swedish trials should be analyzed to specifically estimate the natural history and performance of screening in this age group.}

	abstract = {The standard approach to early detection of disease with a quantitative marker is to set a population-based fixed reference level for making further individual screening or referral decisions. For many types of disease, including prostate and ovarian cancer, additional information is contained in the subject-specific temporal behavior of the marker, which exhibits a characteristic alteration early in the course of the disease. In this article we derive a Bayesian approach to screening based on calculation of the posterior probability of disease given longitudinal marker levels. The method is motivated by a randomized ovarian cancer screening trial in the United Kingdom comprising 22,000 women screened over 4 years with an additional 5 years of follow-up on average. Levels of the antigen CA125 were recorded annually in the screened arm. CA125 profiles of cases and controls from the U.K. trial are modeled using hierarchical changepoint and mixture models, posterior distributions are calculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and the model is used to calculate the Bayesian posterior risk of having ovarian cancer given a new subject's single or multiple longitudinal CA125 levels. A screening strategy based on the risk calculation is then evaluated using data from an independent screening trial of 5,550 women performed in Sweden. A longitudinal CA125 screening strategy based on calculation of the risk of ovarian cancer is proposed. Simulations of a prospective trial using a strategy based on the risk calculated from longitudinal CA125 values indicate potentially large increases in sensitivity for a given specificity compared to the standard approach based on a fixed CA125 reference level for all subjects.},

Overall, the relative risk of developing AIDS by any given time after seroconversion was 1.45 for each 10 year increase in age (p = 0.002; 95\% confidence limits of 1.15, 1.85; Cox proportional hazards model). After adjustment for the CD4+ T-cell count (median of 10 count measurements per patient, fitted as a time-dependent covariate), the relative risk fell to 1.31 but remained statistically significant (p less than 0.05; 95\% confidence limits of 1.03, 1.67). This implies that older people may be at higher risk of progression than their younger counterparts, even if their CD4+ T-cell counts are the same. Hence, prophylaxis against opportunistic infections may be indicated at higher CD4+ T-cell counts in older people than in younger people},

The biological information that can be incorporated into the model includes timing and rates of dynamic cell processes such as differentiation, migration, growth, and replication. The dose-response models produced can explain patterns of malformation rates as a function of both dose and time of exposure, resulting in improvements in risk assessment and understanding of the underlying mechanistic processes.

Variable selection in such partial linear model has direct application to high-dimensional survival analyses that attempt to adjust for clinical predictors. In the microarray setting, previous methods can adjust for other clinical predictors by assuming that clinical and gene expression data enter the model linearly in the same fashion. Here, we select important variables after adjusting for prognostic clinical variables but the clinical effects are assumed nonlinear. Our estimator is based on stratification and can be extended naturally to account for multiple nonlinear effects. We illustrate the utility of our method through simulation studies and application to the Wisconsin prognostic breast cancer data set.},

However, some uncertainty remains about the effects of early aspirin in particular categories of patient with acute stroke. METHODS: To assess the balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in particular categories of patient with acute stroke (eg, the elderly, those without a CT scan, or those with atrial fibrillation), a prospectively planned meta-analysis is presented of the data from 40 000 individual patients from both trials on events that occurred in the hospital during the scheduled treatment period (4 weeks in CAST, 2 weeks in IST), with 10 characteristics used to define 28 subgroups. This represents 99\% of the worldwide evidence from randomized trials. RESULTS: There was a highly significant reduction of 7 per 1000 (SD 1) in recurrent ischemic stroke (320 [1.6\%] aspirin versus 457 [2. 3\%] control, 2P{\textless}0.000001) and a less clearly significant reduction of 4 (SD 2) per 1000 in death without further stroke (5.0\% versus 5. 4\%, 2P=0.05). Against these benefits, there was an increase of 2 (SD 1) per 1000 in hemorrhagic stroke or hemorrhagic transformation of the original infarct (1.0\% versus 0.8\%, 2P=0.07) and no apparent effect on further stroke of unknown cause (0.9\% versus 0.9\%). In total, therefore, there was a net decrease of 9 (SD 3) per 1000 in the overall risk of further stroke or death in hospital (8.2\% versus 9.1\%, 2P=0.001). For the reduction of one third in recurrent ischemic stroke, subgroup-specific analyses found no significant heterogeneity of the proportional benefit of aspirin (chi(2)(18)=20. 9, NS), even though the overall treatment effect (chi(2)(1)=24.8, 2P{\textless}0.000001) was sufficiently large for such subgroup analyses to be statistically informative. The absolute risk among control patients was similar in all 28 subgroups, so the absolute reduction of approximately 7 per 1000 in recurrent ischemic stroke does not differ substantially with respect to age, sex, level of consciousness, atrial fibrillation, CT findings, blood pressure, stroke subtype, or concomitant heparin use. There was no good evidence that the apparent decrease of approximately 4 per 1000 in death without further stroke was reversed in any subgroup or that in any subgroup the increase in hemorrhagic stroke was much larger than the overall average of approximately 2 per 1000. Finally, there was no significant heterogeneity between the reductions in the composite outcome of any further stroke or death (chi(2)(18)=16.5, NS). Among the 9000 patients (22\%) randomized without a prior CT scan, aspirin appeared to be of net benefit with no unusual excess of hemorrhagic stroke; moreover, even among the 800 (2\%) who had inadvertently been randomized after a hemorrhagic stroke, there was no evidence of net hazard (further stroke or death, 63 aspirin versus 67 control). CONCLUSIONS: Early aspirin is of benefit for a wide range of patients, and its prompt use should be routinely considered for all patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, mainly to reduce the risk of early recurrence.}

Analysis of 17.38 megabases of unique sequence, representing about 17\% of the genome, reveals 3,744 protein coding genes, 81 transfer RNAs and numerous repeat elements. Heterochromatic regions surrounding the putative centromere, which has not yet been completely sequenced, are characterized by an increased frequency of a variety of repeats, new repeats, reduced recombination, lowered gene density and lowered gene expression. Roughly 60\% of the predicted protein-coding genes have been functionally characterized on the basis of their homology to known genes. Many genes encode predicted proteins that are homologous to human and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins.}

These were supplemented by estimates in order to provide comparable information on cancer incidence and mortality in the 15 member states of the European Union (EU). The estimated numbers of new cases of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 1990 were approximately 706,900 in men and 644,200 in women. Approximately 497,500 men and 398,200 women died of cancer in the same year. The main sites of incident cases in men were lung (21\%), large bowel (13\%), prostate (12\%), bladder (7\%) and stomach (7\%). For women, the predominant sites were breast (28\%), large bowel (15\%), lung (6\%), uterine corpus (5\%) and stomach (5\%). The overall incidence rates for males were highest in continental Western Europe (France, The Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany and Italy) while the rates of Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Finland, the U.K. and Denmark were below the average value for the EC. Rates for females were highest in Northern and Western Europe, with the exception of France, which had a relatively low rate for females, in common with Greece, Spain and Portugal. The geographical variations in incidence of the major cancers are discussed in relation to risk factors. The estimates show the substantial burden of cancer in European Union populations, but there are also indications of effects of past preventive measures and there is scope for further intervention. Cancer registries are an important source of information for cancer control since they provide population-based incidence and survival statistics. These, along with mortality data, are required to obtain a full picture of the frequency of cancer and its effects at the population level. Some 44\% of the EU population is covered by registries. The European Network of Cancer Registries aims to standardise the information provided by existing registries and to provide practical assistance to those in development.}

It may be a correlate of the rate of breast tissue aging, as proposed by Pike to explain breast cancer age-incidence. We examined longitudinal changes in PMD in 645 breast screening attendees in London, UK, in which each had between 2 and 5 screens spanning 3-12 years at ages 50-65 years and compare these to Pike's model. Within-woman PMD declined during these ages, with a slowing rate of decline. Annual rates of decline were 1.4\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.2-1.6), 0.7\% (0.6-0.9) and 0.1\% (-0.2 to 0.4) at ages 50, 57 and 64. Dense area declined similarly, but the absolute magnitude of the rate of increase of nondense area was almost double that of dense area. PMD dropped by 2.4\% (1.4-3.4) on menopausal transition and increased by 2.4\% (1.4-3.5) with the use of hormone therapy. Higher body mass index, greater parity and being Afro-Caribbean or South Asian ethnicities were associated with lower PMD, but did not affect rate of change of PMD at these ages. Within-woman rank correlation of PMD was 0.80 for readings taken 9 years apart. Effects of menopause and parity and the lack of effect of menarche on age-specific PMD at these ages are consistent with the predicted determinants in Pike's model. A high degree of tracking of PMD indicates that at ages 50-65 years high-risk women could be identified by a single early screen at age older than 50.},

Some population-based studies on cancer patients support the idea of the role of gender in predicting survival. However, the data are somewhat contrasting and inconclusive. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the prognostic role of gender for cancer patients, making use of the large set of survival data made available by the EUROCARE II project for the period 1985-1989. By applying a multivariate approach the major confounders such as age, geographical area and cancer site were considered in analysing survival data on more than 1 million cancer cases collected by 45 population-based cancer registries in 17 European countries. The results were consistent with the general observation that in the industrialised countries women tend to survive longer than men. The multivariate analysis showed better survival from cancer in women than in men, estimated as an overall 2\% lower relative risk of dying. The female advantage was particularly evident in young cases, reduced in patients in middle age groups and in the oldest patients completely reversed so that at this age men had the better prognosis. Longer survival for women was not present immediately after diagnosis, but the major advantage was seen after 3 years of follow-up. The risk of death for women was significantly lower for cancer of the head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, liver and pancreas. For bladder cancer, the risk of death was significantly greater for women. These results can be explained by gender differences in sub-site distributions (head and neck and stomach) and by the differences in the stage at diagnosis (presumably bladder). However, the consistency of the data, evident only when a vast set of data is analysed, suggest that women may be intrinsically more robust than men in coping with cancer.}

In order to take into account patients who, although resident in Padua, had a coronary angiography performed outside Padua or even abroad, all Italian Hemodynamic Centers and the Office for Foreign Cures Authorization of ULSS 21 were contacted. Follow-up was stopped on April, 1991. Patients were first checked if living by consulting the Register's Office of the Community of Padua; they were then interviewed by letter on state of health. One hundred twenty-four patients underwent 138 coronary angiography. Utilization rate is 5.6 per 10,000 people (CI 4.6-6.6). This figure is lower than the present USA utilization rate, and is similar to the rate of late 70's. From patient records, 3 out 8 groups emerged as predominant indication for coronary angiography: unstable angina (37\%), valvular heart disease (20\%) and recent myocardial infarction (20\%). According the ACC/AHA guidelines, indication was considered "appropriate" in 69\%, "inappropriate" in 7\%, "doubtful" in 20\% and impossible to evaluate in 5\% of cases. Although this classification may have been built up with incomplete information, it is note-worthy that the percentage of inappropriate indication is comparable to that of other reports. A further observation is that not in every case the treatment assigned at the time of diagnostic angiography was really carried out on the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

The aim of this paper is to present estimates of prostate cancer mortality, incidence and prevalence over the period 1970-2005 for the Italian regions and for Italy as a whole, and to assess the changes that opportunistic screening and the diffusion of more effective treatments introduced. METHODS: Estimated figures for incidence, prevalence and mortality were obtained with the MIAMOD method. Starting from the knowledge of mortality in the period 1970-1999 and of the relative survival in the period of diagnosis 1978-1994, we derived incidence and prevalence estimates up to the year 2005 by means of a statistical back-calculation approach. Survival at regional and national levels was modelled on the basis of published survival data from the Italian cancer registries. RESULTS: The incidence trend showed a steep increase all over the country during the entire estimation period 1970-2005 with a more pronounced increase in the Center-North then in the South of Italy. Incidence of northern and central regions was about twice as high as that of southern regions. Mortality trends were however constant or declining in the majority of northern-central regions, while they still increased in the South. A total of around 43,000 incident cases, 174,000 prevalent cases and 9,000 deaths were estimated for Italy in 2005. DISCUSSION: The effects of opportunistic screening are reflected in an earlier diagnosis for many patients. The existing North-South gradient in incidence seems to be associated with the different spread of the PSA test in different parts of the country. Prostate cancer remains a great health problem in terms of both incidence and prevalence.}

The haemolytic activity also declined until about half the magnesium had been removed, after which there was little further change. The selective release of acid hydrolases from macrophages in culture increased up to the point at which half the magnesium had been removed but by 90\% depletion had declined rapidly.

A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below.05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or "noteworthy." We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators--that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.}

	annote = {OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is the most commonly registered cancer in Australian men, yet there is a lack of information about its management. We described the patterns and trends in the surgical treatment of men with prostate cancer in New South Wales (NSW). METHOD: We used probabilistic record linkage to link cancer registry data with hospital admissions. All NSW men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1993 and 2002 were eligible for the study. Rates of radical prostatectomy, bilateral orchidectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate were calculated. Factors affecting the probability of undergoing these procedures were examined using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: Between January 1993 and December 2002, 38,712 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in NSW. Of these, 33,200 (85.8\%) cancer registry records were linked to at least one hospital admission record. Men resident in rural areas at diagnosis (RR = 0.69, 95\% Cl 0.65-0.73) and men resident in more socio-economically disadvantaged areas (RR =0.83, 95\% Cl 0.78-0.89 for most disadvantaged) were significantly less likely to undergo a radical prostatectomy after adjusting for age and disease stage. While orchidectomy rates fell significantly during the period, rates were significantly higher in rural and lower socio-economic areas after adjusting for age and stage. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the variation in the surgical patterns of care for prostate cancer so that interventions can be implemented to ensure appropriate access for all men.}

Epidemiological studies have been equivocal in their analysis of the incidence of disease among mechanics servicing brakes. Decomposition of asbestos occurs during the normal usage of the brake due to thermal decomposition into forsterite, although not all asbestos is so converted. Short fibers, below 5 microm in length, are also found in brake products. Several facts are discussed including the toxicity of the remaining asbestos fibers, short asbestos fibers, and the health implications of exposure to forsterite. Control methodologies, when used appropriately, have reduced exposure to asbestos during brake servicing, but have not been able to entirely eliminate exposure to asbestos, thus bring into question the controlled use of asbestos for friction product such as brakes. Even the so called "controlled" use of asbestos containing brakes poses a health risk to workers, users, and their families.}

More specifically, we adopt a fully Bayesian approach based on Gaussian pairwise difference priors where additional smoothing parameters are treated as unknown as well. We argue that the methods are useful in monitoring the effectiveness of mass cancer screening and illustrate this through an application to data on cervical cancer in the former German Democratic Republic. The results suggest that there are large spatial differences in the stage proportions, which indicate spatial variability with respect to the introduction and effectiveness of Pap smear screening programs.}

METHODS: Women aged 18-50 (N = 4389) attended one of three Planned Parenthood clinics between 1997 and 2001 for screening by ThinPrep Papanicolaou and polymerase chain reaction-based human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. Women with 1) any cytologic abnormality, 2) high-risk HPV types, and 3) a random sample with normal Papanicolaou and negative HPV tests were offered repeat cytology, colposcopy, and biopsy. Cytology and biopsy diagnoses at the colposcopy visit were reviewed according to the presence (n = 3689) or absence (n = 700) of a transformation zone component at screening. RESULTS: Among women with normal cytology at screening, histologic detection of at least cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (odds ratio 1.3, 95\% confidence interval 0.5, 3.3) at colposcopy did not differ significantly between transformation zone-positive and zone-negative smears. Histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 was detected more often among smears lacking a transformation zone component (odds ratio 2.0, confidence interval 1.0, 3.8). Transformation zone-negative smears were more common among older women, current oral contraceptive users, those past the 14th day of their last menstrual period, and those negative for high-risk HPV types. CONCLUSION: Absence of a transformation zone component in a screening ThinPrep Papanicolaou test was not associated with missed high-grade lesions. Based upon our data, we do not recommend repeat screening of reproductive-aged women with negative liquid-based tests and no cytologic evidence of a transformation zone component.}

OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential health and economic effects of an HPV vaccine in a setting of existing screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A Markov model was used to estimate the lifetime (age 12-85 years) costs and life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of women screened for cervical cancer in the United States. Three strategies were compared: (1) vaccination only; (2) conventional cytological screening only; and (3) vaccination followed by screening. Two of the strategies incorporated a vaccine targeted against a defined proportion of high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types. Screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and starting ages for screening of 18, 22, 24, 26, and 30 years were chosen for 2 of the strategies (conventional cytological screening only and vaccination followed by screening). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening conducted every 3 and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more frequent screening intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were preferred. Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had the most attractive cost-effectiveness ratio (44 889 dollars) compared with screening only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3 years. However, the strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning at age 18 years had the largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality at a cost of 236 250 dollars per life-year gained compared with vaccination and annual screening beginning at age 22 years. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination plus delayed screening was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, and cost of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination for HPV in combination with screening can be a cost-effective health intervention, but it depends on maintaining effectiveness during the ages of peak oncogenic HPV incidence. Identifying the optimal age for vaccination should be a top research priority.}

Despite its high morbidity, the etiology of prostate cancer remains largely unknown. Advancing age, race, and a family history of prostate cancer are the only established risk factors. Many putative risk factors, including androgens, diet, physical activity, sexual factors, inflammation, and obesity, have been implicated, but their roles in prostate cancer etiology remain unclear. It is estimated that as much as 42\% of the risk of prostate cancer may be accounted for by genetic influences, including individual and combined effects of rare, highly penetrant genes, more common weakly penetrant genes, and genes acting in concert with each other. Numerous genetic variants in the androgen biosynthesis/metabolism, carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, and chronic inflammation pathways, have been explored, but the results are largely inconclusive. The pathogenesis of prostate cancer likely involves interplay between environmental and genetic factors. To unravel these complex relationships, large well-designed interdisciplinary epidemiologic studies are needed. With newly available molecular tools, a new generation of large-scale multidisciplinary population-based studies is beginning to investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Results of these studies may lead to better detection, treatment, and, ultimately, prevention of prostate cancer.}

The best-tolerated and most potent initial HAART regimen is unknown and was investigated in this study. METHODS: One hundred and nine HIV-infected adults with no prior antiretroviral therapy, and CD4 lymphocyte counts {\textless} 500 x 10(6) cells/l or plasma HIV RNA {\textgreater} 30,000 copies/ml were randomized to zidovudine-lamivudine-indinavir (ZDV-3TC-IDV), stavudine-lamivudine- indinavir (d4T-3TC-IDV) or stavudine-didanosine-indinavir (d4T-ddI-IDV) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoints were plasma HIV RNA and drug- related adverse events. Other assessments were overall safety, adherence and adverse events, CD4 lymphocyte counts, cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and quality of life (Euroqol). RESULTS: Only 58\% patients had HIV RNA {\textless} 50 copies/ml plasma at 12 months, with no significant difference between the three regimes (P = 0.34). Drug-related adverse events sufficiently severe to warrant drug discontinuation were less common (P = 0.06) in patients receiving d4T- 3TC-IDV (18\%) than in those receiving ZDV-3TC-IDV (34\%) or d4T-ddI-IDV (41\%). The percentages of patients who remained on their assigned therapy with plasma HIV RNA {\textless} 50 copies/ml at 52 weeks were 60\% with d4T-3TC-IDV, 53\% with ZDV-3TC-IDV and 35\% with d4T-ddI-IDV. Virological failure at 52 weeks was more likely in those whose adherence was estimated to be {\textless} 100\% in the first 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.02), but not in those who developed grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events. At 52 weeks, the mean CD4 lymphocyte count increase was 200 x 10(6) cells/l with only 7\% of patients having counts lower than at baseline; DTH responses improved but remained clinically impaired in most patients. Quality of life improved significantly in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Initial HAART regimens including IDV failed to suppress plasma HIV RNA to {\textless} 50 copies/ml in {\textgreater} 40\% patients after only 12 months of therapy although there was significant overall improvement immunologically and in quality of life. The type of dual nucleoside combination used was less important in predicting virological failure than was imperfect adherence early in therapy. Consideration should be given to modifying a HAART regimen relatively early in non-adherent patients},

This study assesses the current practices and opinions of doctors in China routinely involved in the treatment of stroke, and compares them with those of British doctors. Methods. Questionnaires about the usual management of acute ischemic stroke were sent to 247 Chinese hospitals (mostly urban) collaborating in an acute stroke trial, seeking responses from five doctors (one consultant, two registrars, and two house officers) in each. After one mailing, 1,095 doctors (89\%) responded. Results. Sixty-nine percent of the hospitals had computed tomography scanners, and 88\% of the doctors in those hospitals reported that they would routincly scan acute stroke patients (78\% usually within 24 hours of admission and 22\% only later). Sixty-two percent of doctors reported average hospital stays of 2 to 4 weeks, whereas 36\% reported longer average stays. Treatments reported to be used routinely within the first 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke included glycerol or mannitol (69\% of doctors), Chinese herb products (66\%), calcium antagonists (54\%), and aspirin (53\%); for each of these treatments, over 70\% of all doctors believed it produced definite benefit. Reported routine use of dextran (44\%), snake venom (32\%), "photo-therapy" (22\%), and steroids (19\%) was also moderately common, and about half of all doctors believed each was beneficial. In contrast, routine use of thrombolytic agents (4\%) or anticoagulants (1\%) was uncommon. Only one third of the doctors reported active treatment of hypertension immediately after admission. Conclusions. Comparison with a similar survey in Britain showed reported use of most treatments for acute ischemic stroke was more extensive in China, but that within both countries there was wide variation. The substantial variations in clinical practice both within and between China, the United Kingdom and other countries reflect, at least in part, the substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of many of the possible treatments for acute ischemic stroke. Large-scale randomized evidence is needed to confirm or refute the efficacy of these and newer treatments for acute stroke.}

DESIGN AND METHODS: Using Kaplan-Meier methods, allowing for late entry, we analysed CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe) data from HIV-infected individuals with known dates of seroconversion. We tested the association of time to initiation of therapy and of survival with: exposure category, age, sex, presentation during acute infection and calendar year at risk (as time-dependent) in Cox proportional hazards models, stratifying by study. We estimated the mean CD4 cell count at the initiation of therapy using interval regression. RESULTS: Of 5893 seroconverters, 1613 (27.4\%) died. The risk of death was 65\% lower (95\% CI = 57-72\%) in 1997-99 compared to previous years. Being at risk in earlier calendar years, older age and a short interval between negative and positive test dates were associated with shorter survival. At the same time from seroconversion, people at risk in 1997-99, older individuals and people with a short test interval were more likely to initiate therapy. Injecting drug users (IDUs) were less likely to initiate therapy compared to those exposed through sex between men (RR = 0.79, 95\% CI = 0.69-0.89). The mean CD4 cell count at therapy initiation was 205 cells/mL, which increased significantly over time. Although the earlier initiation of therapy was consistent with longer survival in the 1997-99 period, we found no evidence of this in other calendar periods. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant and substantial reduction in the risk of death and a significant trend of earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1997-99 period. Although IDUs were less likely to initiate therapy their overall survival did not appear to differ from others. The increasing tendency to initiate ART closer to seroconversion has unknown long-term consequences which require monitoring},

DESIGN: The mean increase in CD4 cell count and rate of virological failure after commencing HAART were measured in antiretroviral-naive patients (1421) in a large, non-randomized multicentre, observational study in Italy (ICONA). Clinical endpoints were also evaluated in a subset of patients who started HAART with a very low CD4 cell count. RESULTS: After 96 weeks of therapy, the mean rise in CD4 cell count was 280, 281 and 186 x 10(6) cells/l in patients starting HAART with a CD4 cell count {\textless} 200, 201--350 and {\textgreater} 350 x 10(6) cells/l, respectively. Patients starting HAART with a CD4 cell count {\textless} 200 x 10(6) cells/l tended to have a higher risk of subsequent virological failure [relative hazard (RH), 1.15; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.93--1.42] compared with patients starting with {\textgreater} 350 x 10(6) cells/l.

Predictions were based on the observed mortality to the end of 1986 and modelling of the mesothelioma rate. Elimination of crocidolite from the lungs was included in the model. Between the years 1987 and 2020 it is predicted that between 250 and 680 deaths will occur due to mesothelioma. This wide range is due to uncertainty on the functional form of the relation between mesothelioma rate and time, and insufficient data to estimate the elimination rate of crocidolite from the lungs. The most likely range is the lower half of this total range--that is, between 250 and 500. It is predicted that between 340 and 465 deaths will occur due to lung cancer. About 45\% of these deaths would be attributable to exposure to asbestos. It is estimated that currently there are up to 200 cases of undiagnosed asbestosis. Of these about 50 will die of lung cancer or mesothelioma and are therefore also included in the figures above. Up to 60 former workers may develop the first signs of asbestosis in the future but any such cases are likely to progress to more serious disease at a much slower rate than the cases that have already been identified.}

METHODS: The estimates were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence estimates from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian cancer registries were modelled to obtain regional and national estimates of colorectal cancer survival. RESULTS: Different incidence patterns were observed for men and women, especially in the projection period: the national age-standardized rate is estimated to increase throughout the study period 1970-2010 for men from 30 to 70 per 100,000, and to stabilize from the end of the 1990s for women at around 38 per 100,000. A stabilization or a slight decrease in age-standardized incidence rates is expected in most regions for women and in most northern-central regions for men. The most critical situation is estimated among men for southern regions, where the rise in incidence is accompanied by a dramatic increase in mortality. About 46,000 incident cases, 267,000 prevalent cases, and 16,000 deaths from colorectal cancer are estimated in Italy for the year 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk reduction estimated in most northern-central regions among men and in the large majority of regions among women, the colorectal cancer burden in Italy is expected to remain relevant in the next years. Prospects for reducing this burden appear mainly connected to the adoption of prevention policies aimed at increasing the awareness of the risk related to dietary habits and lifestyles and at promoting colorectal cancer screening.}

	abstract = {Age-period-cohort models have provided useful insights into the analysis of time trends for disease rates, in spite of the well known identifiability problem. Unique parameter estimates that avoid arbitrary constraints are provided by estimable functions of the parameter estimates. For data that are generated using equal interval widths for age and period, the identifiability issue may be expressed in terms of the age, period and cohort slopes. However, when the interval widths are not the same for age and period, additional identifiability problems arise. These may be represented in terms of macro-trends, which have the identical identifiability problem seen in the equal interval case, and micro-trends, which are the source of the additional problems. A framework for testing estimability is presented, and a variety of potentially interesting functions of the parameters considered. Unlike the equal interval case, drift is not estimable for unequal intervals, but local drift may be. In addition, the available functions for forecasting are much more restrictive in the latter case. This estimability problem induces cyclical patterns in the estimates of trend as is demonstrated using data on leukaemia in Connecticut males, but this can be avoided through the use of smoothing splines. These methods of are illustrated for three-year period and five-year age intervals using data on lung cancer mortality in Californian women.},

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1572 women with a community-based LSIL interpretation were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy, triage based on enrollment HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology at a colposcopy referral threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or conservative management based on repeat cytology at a referral threshold of HSIL. All arms included 2 years of semiannual follow-up and colposcopy at exit. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was offered to women with histologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 at any visit or persistent CIN grade 1 at exit. The main study end point was 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3. RESULTS: The 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3 was approximately 15\% in all study arms. The HPV triage arm was closed early because more than 80\% of women were HPV positive, precluding efficient triage. The immediate colposcopy strategy yielded 55.9\% sensitivity for cumulative cases of CIN grade 3 diagnosed over 2 years. A conservative management strategy of repeat cytology at the HSIL threshold referred 18.8\% of women while detecting 48.4\% of cumulative CIN grade 3. At lower cytology thresholds, sensitivity would improve but would ultimately yield unacceptably high referral rates. CONCLUSION: LSIL cytology is best managed by colposcopy initially, because there was no useful triage strategy identified. Management of these patients, after colposcopy to rule out immediately overt CIN grade 2 or 3, needs to be determined.}

The independent effect of hormone replacement therapy on development of cytologic abnormalities is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the positive predictive value of cervical smears in previously screened postmenopausal women and to determine the effect of oral estrogen plus progestin on incident cervical cytologic abnormalities. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (incidence) and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (hormone therapy). SETTING: 20 U.S. outpatient and community clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 2561 women with a uterus and normal cytologic characteristics at baseline. INTERVENTIONS: Annual smears; oral conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, or identical placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Incident cytologic abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance, low-grade squamous epithelial lesion, and high-grade squamous epithelial lesion) and final histologic diagnoses. RESULTS: The incidence of new cytologic abnormalities in the 2 years following a normal smear was 110 per 4895 person-years (23 per 1000 person-years [95\% CI, 18 to 27 per 1000 person-years]). Among the 103 women with known histologic diagnoses, one had mild to moderate dysplasia. The positive predictive value of any smear abnormality identified 1 year after a normal smear, therefore, was 0\% (CI, 0\% to 5.0\%) (0 of 78 women); the positive predictive value of abnormalities found within 2 years was 0.9\% (CI, 0.0\% to 3.0\%) (1 of 110 women). In hormone-treated compared with non-hormone-treated women, the incidence of cytologic abnormalities was nonsignificantly higher (relative hazard, 1.36 [CI, 0.93 to 1.99]), largely because of a nonsignificant 58\% greater incidence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (relative hazard, 1.58 [CI, 0.99 to 2.52]). CONCLUSIONS: Because of a poor positive predictive value, cervical smears should not be performed within 2 years of normal cytologic results in postmenopausal women. Therapy with oral estrogen plus progestin does not significantly affect the incidence of cytologic abnormalities.}

METHODS: A structured telephone survey of a quota sample of 1,420 New York City women from four Hispanic groups (Columbian, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Ecuadorian) and three black groups (U.S., Caribbean, and Haitian) was performed. Outcome measures included "ever" and "recent" self-reported use of mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and Pap smears. Logistic regression models assessed the predictors of screening use. RESULTS: Having a regular source of care significantly predicted all screening use for both elderly and nonelderly, controlling for ethnicity, sociodemographics, health status, access to care, proportion of life in the United States, and cancer attitudes. Elderly women ({\textgreater}/=65 years) were significantly less likely to have ever had (OR = 0.79, 95\% CI 0.65-0. 96) and to have recently had (OR = 0.67, 95\% CI 0.57-0.79) Pap smears than younger women, controlling for the other variables; being elderly also tended to be an independent predictor of ever and recent mammography and CBE use. Interestingly, there was a trend for health status to act differently in predicting Pap smear use for the two age groups. For younger women, being in poor health increased the odds of Pap smear screening, while for elderly women, being in good health increased the odds of screening. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly women reported being screened less than younger women; interactions between health status and age need further exploration.}

The considered data are arranged in a two-way table by age group and calendar period, which are mostly subdivided into 5- or 10-year intervals. The disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information by data aggregation and the problems of estimating interactions in the two-way layout without replications. In this article we show how splines can be useful when yearly data, i.e., 1-year age groups and 1-year periods, are given. The estimated spline curves are still smooth and represent yearly changes in the time trends. Further, it is straightforward to include interaction terms by the tensor product of the spline functions. If the data are given in a nonrectangular table, e.g., 5-year age groups and 1-year periods, the period and cohort variables can be parameterized by splines, while the age variable is parameterized as fixed effect levels, which leads to a semiparametric apc model. An important methodological issue in developing the nonparametric and semiparametric models is stability of the estimated spline curve at the boundaries. Here cubic regression splines will be used, which are constrained to be linear in the tails. Another point of importance is the nonidentifiability problem due to the linear dependency of the three time variables. This will be handled by decomposing the basis of each spline by orthogonal projection into constant, linear, and nonlinear terms, as suggested by Holford (1983, Biometrics 39, 311-324) for the traditional apc model. The advantage of using splines for yearly data compared to the traditional approach for aggregated data is the more accurate curve estimation for the nonlinear trend changes and the simple way of modeling interactions between the time variables. The method will be demonstrated with hypothetical data as well as with cancer mortality data.}

All seven groups used the same sources to obtain data on the use of screening mammography, adjuvant treatment, and benefits of treatment with respect to the rate of death from breast cancer. RESULTS: The proportion of the total reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer attributed to screening varied in the seven models from 28 to 65 percent (median, 46 percent), with adjuvant treatment contributing the rest. The variability across models in the absolute contribution of screening was larger than it was for treatment, reflecting the greater uncertainty associated with estimating the benefit of screening.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production was measured in whole blood of 223 HIV-seropositive individuals (68 had developed AIDS at enrollment) and 99 healthy sex- and age-matched controls 4.5 hr after challenge with phytohemagglutinin. HIV-infected individuals for whom IFN-gamma production was measured were followed with a median follow-up time of 2.89 years (range, 0.02-4.54 years) from the date of enrollment. Survival analysis was performed considering three different end points: (1) a CD4 count below 100 cells/mm3, (2) an AIDS diagnosis defined according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control definition, and (3) death. The production of IFN-gamma was highly increased in the blood of HIV-infected individuals without AIDS, but decreased in the blood of AIDS patients (both compared to controls). In the HIV-infected individuals, the total production of IFN-gamma was positively correlated with the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes and with the number of CD16+/CD56+ natural killer cells and negatively correlated with serum levels of beta2-microglobulin. Low levels of IFN-gamma production were associated with an increased risk of experiencing a CD4 count below 100 cells/m3 and death, analyzed in both univariate analysis and in multivariate analysis adjusting for CD4 counts and age. Thus, changes in production of IFN-gamma seem to be truly related to the risk for disease progression in HIV infection},

The purpose of this study was to compare the prediagnosis evaluation and first-year treatment costs of persons diagnosed with colorectal cancer, stratified by whether the cancer was detected by screening using fecal occult blood testing or evaluation of symptoms. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed persons diagnosed with colorectal cancer from 1993 to 1999 in Group Health Cooperative, a large health maintenance organization in Washington state. Total health care costs during 3 months before and 12 months following diagnosis were compared for screen-detected versus symptom-detected individuals. RESULTS: During this time, 206 cancers were detected by screening and 717 by symptoms. In the 3 months before diagnosis, total costs were 7346 US dollars for persons with screen-detected versus 10,042 US dollars for those with symptom-detected cancer (P {\textless} 0.01). Stratified by stage, diagnosis costs were significantly lower for persons with stage B cancer (7282 US dollars vs. 11,682 US dollars ; P {\textless} 0.01) and nonsignificantly lower for other stages. A total of 53\% of screen-detected cases were Dukes' stage A or in situ at diagnosis versus 30\% of symptom-detected cases (P {\textless} 0.01). Overall costs were lower for the screen-detected group in the 12 months following diagnosis (22,369 US dollars vs. 29,471 US dollars; P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer screening can substantially reduce prediagnosis evaluation costs. These savings are of interest to health plans and should be factored into cost-effectiveness evaluations of screening programs.}

We consider the problem of equivalence test with a relative risk endpoint in matched-pair studies with binary outcomes, and develop several score and Wald-type statistics for testing a hypothesis of non-unity relative risk. Examples from an assessment of HIV screening test and a cross-over clinical trial of soft contact lenses are used to illustrate the proposed methods. Through simulations we compare the empirical performance of these tests with the test proposed by Lachenbruch and Lynch. We show that a score test based on a reparameterized multinomial model by Tango performs best in the sense that the test satisfactorily controls the type I error rate and its empirical type I error rates are generally much closer to the prespecified nominal significance level than those of the other tests.},

Cumulative relative survival curves for both cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum generally plateau after approximately 6-8 years.

We analyzed data from the Finnish Cancer Registry over a 50-year period using methods that simultaneously estimate the proportion of patients cured of disease (the cure fraction) and the survival time distribution of the "uncured" group. Our primary aim was to investigate temporal trends in the cure fraction and median survival of the uncured by age group for both cancer of the colon and rectum. For both cancers, the cure fraction has increased dramatically over time for all age groups. However, the difference in the cure fraction between age groups has reduced over time, particularly for cancer of the colon. Median survival in the uncured has also increased over time in all age groups but there still remains an inverse relationship between age and median survival, with shorter median survival with increasing age. The reasons for these impressive increases in patient survival are complex, but are highly likely to be strongly related to many improvements in cancer care over this same time period.

For 2 years (October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1993) data were collected by community child health nurses on all infants born in New Zealand at initial contact and at 2 months.Results. There were 232 SIDS cases in the postneonatal age group (2.0/1000 live births) and these were compared with 1200 randomly selected control subjects. Information was available for 127 cases (54.7\%) and 922 (76.8\%) of controls.The previously identified modifiable risk factors were examined. The prevalence of prone sleeping position of the infant was very low (0.7\% at initial contact and 3.0\% at 2 months), but was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS. In addition, the side sleeping position was also found to have an increased risk of SIDS compared with the supine sleeping position (at 2 months: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.57; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71, 25.23). Maternal smoking was found to be the major risk factor for SIDS. Bed sharing was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and bed sharing on the risk of SIDS. Compared with infants not exposed to either bed sharing or maternal smoking, the adjusted OR for infants of mothers who smoked was 5.01 (95\% CI = 2.01, 12.46) for bed sharing at the initial contact and 5.02 (95\% CI = 1.05, 24.05) for bed sharing at 2 months. In this study breastfeeding was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of SIDS.The other risk factors for SIDS identified were: unmarried mother, leaving school at a younger age, young mother, greater number. of previous pregnancies, late attendance for antenatal care, smoking in pregnancy, male infant, Maori ethnicity, low birth weight, and shorter gestation.Conclusions. After adjustment for potential confounders, prone and side sleeping positions, maternal smoking, and the joint exposure to bed sharing and maternal smoking were associated with statistically significant increased risk of SIDS. A change from the side to the supine sleeping position could result in a substantial reduction in SIDS. Maternal smoking is common in New Zealand and with the reduction in the prevalence of prone sleeping position is now the major risk factor in this country. However, smoking behavior has been difficult to change. Bed sharing is also a major factor but appears only to be a risk to infants of mothers who smoke. Addressing bed sharing among mothers who smoke could reduce SIDS by at least one third. Breastfeeding did not appear to offer a statistically significant reduction in SIDS risk after adjustment of potential confounders, but as breastfeeding rates are comparatively good in New Zealand, this result should be interpreted with caution as the power of this study to detect a benefit is small.},

Outcomes include the predicted impact on resource use, total cost, life years and cost-effectiveness. Extensive sensitivity analysis has been carried out to explore the importance of the uncertainty associated with disease natural history and the impact of screening. Under baseline assumptions, the cost-effectiveness of different options for introducing LBC appears favourable, and these results are consistent under a range of assumptions for its impact on the diagnostic effectiveness of cytology. However, if we assume a higher marginal cost of LBC in comparison to conventional methods, primary smear testing options are predicted to be more cost-effective without LBC. Combined LBC primary smear and HPV testing with a 5-year interval is similar in both cost and effectiveness to the other 3-yearly options of primary smear testing or primary HPV testing alone. However, both primary HPV testing and combined options would give rise to a far greater risk of inappropriate colposcopy throughout a woman's lifetime.British Journal of Cancer (2004) 91, 84-91. doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6601884 www.bjcancer.com Published online 25 May 2004}

Unspecified cancers and carcinomas were reallocated based on a registry, time period, sex and age group-specific basis. Where available, data from several registries within a country were pooled for analysis. Rates per 100,000 person-years for 1980-1982 to 1995-1997 were age-adjusted by the direct method using the world standard. Squamous cell carcinoma rates among males declined 30\% or more in North America and some European countries while changing less dramatically in other areas; small cell carcinoma rates decreased less rapidly. Squamous and small cell carcinoma rates among females generally rose, with the increases especially pronounced in the Netherlands and Norway. In contrast, adenocarcinoma rates rose among males and females in virtually all areas, with the increases among males exceeding 50\% in many areas of Europe; among females, rates also rose rapidly and more than doubled in Norway, Italy and France. Rates of all lung cancer types among women and adenocarcinoma among men continue to rise despite declining cigarette use in many Western countries and shifts to filtered/low-tar cigarettes.

The objective here is to provide a method for partitioning a linear trend in age-adjusted rates into disease-specific components. METHODS: The method presented is based on linear regression. The decreasing trend in age-adjusted cancer mortality rates for the total United States during the period 1991-96 is analyzed to illustrate the method. RESULTS: Trends in mortality for cancers of the colon/rectum, breast, lung/bronchus, and prostate are found to be responsible for 75\% of the decreasing trend in cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to partition an overall trend in age-adjusted rates under the assumption that it and the trends for all mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups of interest are linear.}

In order to assess these and possible further changes to cervical screening practice in the UK, we constructed a mathematical model of cervical HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer, and of UK age-specific screening coverage rates, screening intervals and treatment efficacy. The predicted cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the UK is 1.70\% in the absence of screening and 0.77\% with pre-2003 screening practice. A reduction in lifetime incidence to 0.63\% is predicted following the implementation of the 2003 NHSCSP recommendations, which represents a 63\% reduction compared to incidence rates in the UK population if it were unscreened. The model suggests that, after the implementation of the 2003 recommendations, increasing the sensitivity of the screening test regime from its current average value of 56 to 90\% would further reduce the cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer to 0.46\%. Alternatively, extending screening to women aged 65-79 years would further reduce the lifetime incidence to 0.56\%. Screening women aged 20-25 years would have minimal impact, with the cumulative lifetime incidence decreasing from 0.63 to 0.61\%. In conclusion, the study supports the 2003 recommendations for changes to cervical screening intervals.}

DESIGN: Retrospective review of case notes of all HIV-infected Africans and a comparison group of non-Africans attending 11 specialist HIV/AIDS Units in London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of demographic information, first and subsequent AIDS-defining conditions, levels of immune deficiency, and chemoprophylactic practices between the African and non-African groups. RESULTS: A total of 1056 Africans (313 developing AIDS) and 992 non-Africans (314 developing AIDS) were studied. Africans presented later than non-Africans (median CD4+ lymphocyte counts at diagnosis 238 and 371 x 10(6)/l, respectively). Tuberculosis accounted for 27\% of initial episodes of AIDS in Africans and 5\% in non-Africans; Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was the initial AIDS-defining condition in 34\% of non-Africans and 17\% of Africans. The incidence of tuberculosis in Africans with another AIDS-indicator disease was 16 per 100 person-years. PCP prophylaxis was prescribed for 40\% Africans and 32\% non-Africans; only 8\% of Africans received tuberculosis preventive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected African patients presented at lower levels of CD4+ lymphocyte count, at a more advanced clinical stage, and with different AIDS-indicator diseases as compared with non-Africans. Prophylaxis against tuberculosis should be considered for all HIV-infected African patients in industrialized countries. The high incidence of diseases that are indicative of advanced immunodeficiency (e.g., cytomegalovirus disease) in African patients contrasts with data from Africa, suggesting better survival chances in the UK},

For all tumors the prevalence increased with age at diagnosis. The cancer prevalence was divided into intervals from diagnosis, expressing different health needs in terms of therapy and intensity of clinical follow-up. For all tumors considered, 1-year prevalence was higher than 1-2-year prevalence, reflecting a high death risk due to perioperative mortality and to the proportion of patients diagnosed at advanced stages. The prevalence decreased in the following intervals considered. Noticeable geographic variability was observed in the prevalence across Italy, with higher proportions being registered in the northern-central regions than in the South. The two extreme 0-5-year prevalence figures (per 100,000) were: for breast cancer 568 (Genova) and 259 (Ragusa); for corpus uteri cancer 94 (Romagna) and 21 (Latina); for cervix uteri cancer 63 (Romagna) and 26 (Latina); for ovarian cancer 49 (Parma) and 21 (Latina); for cancer of the vagina and vulva 17 (Genova) and 5 (Ragusa). This variability depends mainly on incidence and on the proportion of elderly in the general population. From 1987 to 1992 there was an increase in the prevalence of tumors of the breast, ovary and vagina and vulva, especially in the elderly. The prevalence of corpus uteri cancer decreased slightly in the elderly only, whereas that of cervix uteri cancer decreased at all ages.}

MAIN RESULTS--Median follow up was 670 (range 45-1506) days. An acute illness like glandular fever occurred in 46 (53\%) subjects. Three year progression rates to Centers for Disease Control group IV was 78\% at three years for those who had longlasting illnesses (duration greater than or equal to 14 days) during seroconversion as compared with 10\% for those who were free of symptoms or had mild illness. All six patients who developed AIDS had had longlasting primary illnesses. Three year progression rates to a CD4 lymphocyte count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l and to recurrence of HIV antigenaemia were significantly higher for those who had longlasting primary illnesses than those who had no symptoms or mild illness (75\% v 42\% and 55\% v 14\%, respectively).

This functional multiplicative effects model for longitudinal data is compared with an unrestricted nonparametric smooth surface model. In an application to the egg-laying behavior of 936 female medflies, the shape of the egg-laying curves is related to the total number of eggs laid by an individual fly. This sheds light on how reproduction intensity is regulated at the individual level. The proposed multiplicative effects model is compared with an unrestricted multivariate smoothing approach.}

Publication of a wide range of studies with different designs, study populations, and results has fueled uncertainty about the best way to use PSAV and confused the issue of its utility in the early detection setting. Studies of disease prognosis suggest that PSAV is strongly associated with lethal cancers. However, prospective screening trials find that PSAV is at best a weak predictor of high-risk disease. In this commentary, we synthesize and reconcile the evidence about the value of PSAV in the early detection setting. We review recent studies of PSAV and determine a set of statistical considerations that we believe to be critical in study evaluation and interpretation. We explain why the association between PSAV and disease-specific survival does not necessarily imply that PSAV will be a useful screening tool. In addition, we argue that the standard concept of PSAV--the absolute change in PSA per year--confuses disease aggressiveness with the interval from disease onset to detection. We therefore recommend that other methods be explored to incorporate information about PSA kinetics that could ultimately improve--and even transform--how we detect and treat prostate cancer.}

METHODS: Observed probabilities of achieving a viral load {\textless} or = 500 copies/ml by week 24 (days 84-168) from starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were calculated according to viral loads at weeks 4 and 8. RESULTS: A total of 42.4\% of patients (153/361) reached {\textless} or = 500 copies/ml viral load by week 4 and 70.4\% (245/348) by week 8. Viral suppression below 500 copies/ml by 4-8 weeks was similar irrespective of the pre-HAART viral load. In patients with viral loads above 10000 copies/ml at week 4, 60.6\% (20/33) achieved {\textless} or = 500 copies/ml by week 24. In patients with viral loads still above 10000 copies/ml at week 8, only 42.3\% (11/26) achieved {\textless} or = 500 copies/ml by week 24, and only 33.3\% (3/9) maintained viral suppression below 500 copies/ml to week 48. CONCLUSION: Viral loads at weeks 4 and 8 should be monitored to detect early signs of low subsequent viral suppression. For previously antiretroviral-naive patients whose viral loads after 8 weeks of HAART are still above 10000, there is an urgent need to assess adherence to therapy, drug levels and resistance, so management can be modified accordingly to reduce the rate of week 24 virological failure},

The purpose of this work is to present detailed and updated prevalence estimates in Italy over the period 1970-2010 by cancer site (all cancers combined, stomach, colon and rectum, lung, breast and prostate) and gender. METHODS: Prevalence was derived with the MIAMOD statistical method, using cancer-specific mortality and relative survival as input data. Survival data from the Italian cancer registries were modeled to derive a national estimate for each cancer site and sex. To estimate prevalence trends, survival was assumed to improve in the future with the same rate observed in the period 1978-1994. A double scenario for survival--increasing or stationary--was considered to decompose the prevalence growth from 1995 to 2005 by its determinants: demographic changes, incidence and survival dynamics. The prevalence estimates were also decomposed by disease duration (2, 5 and 10 years) and by age (0-44, 45-59, 60-74 and 75-99). RESULTS: The proportion of cancer survivors in 2010 is expected to be about 4\% in women and 3\% in men, about twice the values attained in 1990. The highest dynamics was observed for prostate cancer, with a three-fold increase just in the 1995-2005 period (from 212 to 623 per 100,000), whereas in absolute terms breast cancer presented the highest levels (1700 per 100,000 in 2010). The overall number of cancer prevalent cases is expected to rise by about 48\% in the decennium 1995-2005 (from 1,152,000 to 1,709,000), and this growth is mainly attributable to incidence dynamics (+21\%), then to survival improvements (+14\%) and population aging (13\%). In 2005, the 2-year prevalent cases were estimated to be 20\% of all cancer survivors, 21\% between 2 and 5 years from the diagnosis, 23\% between 5 and 10 years, with 36\% surviving for more than 10 years. Prevalence proportion was very high in the elderly (12.6\% for 75-84 years and 8\% for 60-74 years). CONCLUSIONS: Updated prevalence data with appropriate coverage of the national territory are essential to define priorities in health care management and to develop cancer control programs. Prevalence by disease duration and by age should be the basis for planning research on the quality of life of cancer survivors, as long as cancer continues to become an even more chronic disease.}

Amongst the 59 patients whose date of seroconversion could be estimated the calculated 8-year cumulative incidence of AIDS was 40\% (symptoms 73\%). For the whole cohort of 112 patients, the median slope of linear regression of the absolute T4 lymphocyte count was steeper for those with AIDS (-0.113 x 10(9)/l per year) than for those without AIDS (-0.054 x 10(9)/l per year) (P less than 0.02). While 15 cases of AIDS developed during 58 patient-years of follow up after falling below a T4 lymphocyte count of 0.2 x 10(9)/l, only two cases occurred during 450 patient-years before reaching this count. Thus the decline of the T4 lymphocyte count to 0.2 x 10(9)/l may be an appropriate additional end-point for the assessment of new treatments for asymptomatic patients infected with HIV},

METHODS: The Eternit factory operated from 1907 to 1986. The cohort included 3434 subjects active in 1950 or hired in 1950-86, ascertained from company records, without selections. Local reference rates were used for both mortality and mesothelioma incidence. RESULTS: Mortality was increased in both sexes for all causes (overall 1809 observed (obs) vs 1312.3 expected (exp); p{\textless}0.01), pleural (135 obs vs 3.6 exp; p{\textless}0.01) and peritoneal (52 vs 1.9; p{\textless}0.01) malignancies and lung cancer (249 vs 103.1; p{\textless}0.01). In women, ovarian (9 vs 4.0; p{\textless}0.05) and uterine (15 vs 5.8; p{\textless}0.01) malignancies were also in excess. No statistically significant increase was found for laryngeal cancer (16 obs vs 12.2 exp). In Poisson regression analyses, the RR of death from pleural neoplasm linearly increased with duration of exposure, while it showed a curvilinear increase with latency and time since cessation of exposure. RR for peritoneal neoplasm continued to increase by latency, duration and time since cessation of exposure. RR for lung cancer showed a reduction after 15 years since cessation of exposure and levelled off after 40 years of latency. CONCLUSION: This study of a cohort of asbestos exposed workers with very long follow-up confirmed the reduction in risk of death from lung cancer after the end of exposure. It also suggested a reduction in risk for pleural mesothelioma with over 40 years of latency, while risk for peritoneal mesothelioma showed a continuing increase.}

We apply functional time series models on age-specific breast cancer mortality rates for each group of women, and forecast their mortality curves using exponential smoothing state-space models with damping. Materials and Methods: The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the US [1]. Mortality data were obtained from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) available on the SEER*Stat database. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates from 1969 to 2004 in 5-year age groups (45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84). Age-specific mortality curves were obtained using nonparametric smoothing methods. The curves are then decomposed using functional principal components and we fit functional time series models with four basis functions for each population separately. The curves from each population are forecast and prediction intervals are calculated. Results: Twenty-year forecasts indicate an overall decline in future breast cancer mortality rates for both groups of women. This decline appears to be steeper among white women aged 55-73 and black women aged 60-84. For black women under 55 years of age, the forecast rates are relatively stable indicating there is no significant change in future breast cancer mortality rates among young black women in the next 20 years. Conclusion: White women have smooth and consistent patterns in breast cancer mortality rates for all age-groups whereas the mortality rates for black women are much more variable. The projections suggest, for some age groups, black American women may not benefit equally from the overall decline in breast cancer mortality in the United States. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Slopes of HIV-1 RNA decline in plasma were compared before and after the start of highly suppressive antiretroviral therapy from five acutely infected patients who started treatment 2 to 5 weeks following the onset of clinical symptoms. Slopes of decline after the initiation of therapy were also compared with those found in 12 chronically infected individuals on the same therapy. Numbers and percentages of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells at baseline were compared as well. RESULTS: The pre-treatment slopes of HIV-1 RNA decline in the acutely infected individuals increased significantly (P = 0.0001) after the start of anti-retroviral therapy. However, these post-treatment slopes were lower than those found in the chronically infected individuals (P= 0.012). Slopes were inversely correlated (P= 0.012) with baseline HIV-1 RNA. Although the number of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4 cells was higher in primary infection (P= 0.02), the percentage did not differ between primary and chronic infection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that antiretroviral therapy contributes significantly to the clearance of HIV-1 during primary infection. Based on the mathematical model the less steep RNA slope following the start of treatment in primary infection can be predicted to be the result of lower clearance of productively infected cells and higher burst size per cell per unit time. This may indicate a growing immune response to HIV-1 in this very early stage of infection.}

	annote = {Flexible survival models, which avoid assumptions about hazards proportionality (PH) or linearity of continuous covariates effects, bring the issues of model selection to a new level of complexity. Each 'candidate covariate' requires inter-dependent decisions regarding (i) its inclusion in the model, and representation of its effects on the log hazard as (ii) either constant over time or time-dependent (TD) and, for continuous covariates, (iii) either loglinear or non-loglinear (NL). Moreover, 'optimal' decisions for one covariate depend on the decisions regarding others. Thus, some efficient model-building strategy is necessary.We carried out an empirical study of the impact of the model selection strategy on the estimates obtained in flexible multivariable survival analyses of prognostic factors for mortality in 273 gastric cancer patients. We used 10 different strategies to select alternative multivariable parametric as well as spline-based models, allowing flexible modeling of non-parametric (TD and/or NL) effects. We employed 5-fold cross-validation to compare the predictive ability of alternative models.All flexible models indicated significant non-linearity and changes over time in the effect of age at diagnosis. Conventional 'parametric' models suggested the lack of period effect, whereas more flexible strategies indicated a significant NL effect. Cross-validation confirmed that flexible models predicted better mortality. The resulting differences in the 'final model' selected by various strategies had also impact on the risk prediction for individual subjects.Overall, our analyses underline (a) the importance of accounting for significant non-parametric effects of covariates and (b) the need for developing accurate model selection strategies for flexible survival analyses.}

Considering age or viral load could improve colposcopy triage. METHODS: We determined the sensitivity for detecting Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 (CIN3) and cancer and the percentage of referrals for colposcopy using HPV testing and repeat thin-layer cytopathology in 2198 women with ASCUS and in 848 women with LSIL enrolled in ALTS from November 1996 through December 1998. We analyzed results by age and at two thresholds for HPV load and repeat cytopathology. RESULTS: For ASCUS, the overall sensitivity of HPV testing at 1.0 pg/mL was 96.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 92.8 to 99.5\%) and varied minimally with age (range, 93.9\% to 97.8\%). HPV testing at this threshold would refer 31.2\% (95\% CI = 28.0\% to 34.3\%) of women aged 29 years or older as compared with more than 65\% of younger women. Among women aged 29 years or older with ASCUS, referral for repeat cytopathology of ASCUS had a sensitivity of 90.9\% (95\% CI = 81.1\% to 100.0\%) and would refer 50.1\% (95\% CI = 46.7 to 53.5\%). Among all ASCUS, HPV testing using a 10.0-pg/mL threshold decreased sensitivity to 91.5\% and referrals to 41.7\%. More than 63\% of LSIL would have been referred using any strategy achieving 90\% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: For women with ASCUS, HPV testing was highly sensitive for detecting CIN3 and cancer with dramatically fewer referrals of older women. Neither a single HPV test nor repeat cytopathology provides useful triage for women with LSIL.}

SETTING: Two US states: Massachusetts (1990 population=6,016,425) and Rhode Island (1990 population=1,003,464). PARTICIPANTS: All births born to mothers ages 15 to 55 years old who were residents of either Massachusetts (1989-1991; n=267,311) or Rhode Island (1987-1993; n=96 138), and all children ages 1 to 5 years residing in Rhode Island who were screened for lead levels between 1994 and 1996 (n=62,514 children, restricted to first test during the study period). MAIN RESULTS: Analyses of both the birth weight and lead data indicated that: (a) block group and tract socioeconomic measures performed similarly within and across both states, while ZIP code level measures tended to detect smaller effects; (b) measures pertaining to economic poverty detected stronger gradients than measures of education, occupation, and wealth; (c) results were similar for categories generated by quintiles and by a priori categorical cut off points; and (d) the area based socioeconomic measures yielded estimates of effect equal to or augmenting those detected, respectively, by individual level educational data for birth outcomes and by the area based housing measure recommended by the US government for monitoring childhood lead poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Census tract or block group area based socioeconomic measures of economic deprivation could be meaningfully used in conjunction with US public health surveillance systems to enable or enhance monitoring of social inequalities in health in the United States.}

RESULTS: Children who consumed {\textgreater}2-3, {\textgreater}3-4 and {\textgreater}4 servings of fruit juice/drinks 'yesterday' were, respectively, 1.7 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.2), 1.7 (95\% CI 1.2-2.5) and 2.1 (95\% CI 1.5-2.9) times more likely to be overweight/obese compared with those who had no servings of fruit juice/drink 'yesterday', adjusted for age, gender and socio-economic status (SES). Further, children who had {\textgreater} or = 3 servings of soft drink 'yesterday' were 2.2 (95\% CI 1.3-3.9) times more likely to be overweight/obese compared with those who had no servings of soft drink 'yesterday', adjusted for age, gender and SES.

Although fast foods and packaged snacks were regularly eaten, there were no associations between weight status and consumption of these foods. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of sweetened beverages was associated with overweight and obesity in this population of Australian schoolchildren and should be a target for intervention programmes aimed at preventing unhealthy weight gain in children.}

SUBJECTS: One hundred and eight men who seroconverted for HIV-1 during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression to AIDS and progression to a CD4+ lymphocyte count {\textless} 200 x 10(6)/l. RESULTS: Symptomatic primary HIV infection with fever and skin rash, absence of anti-HIV core and transient HIV p24 antigenemia were independent predictors of progression to AIDS at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. A low CD4+ count immediately after seroconversion and the calendar year were independent predictors of progression to a low CD4+ count at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the earliest stage of HIV-1 infection a small group of individuals at high risk for rapid progression to AIDS can be recognized by the clinical presentation of primary HIV infection, the presence of HIV p24 antigenaemia and the absence of a serological response to HIV core protein.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.
METHODS: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95\% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95\% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
FINDINGS: In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9\% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1\%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9\% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38\% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19\%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6\%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8\%). This was driven by a 46\% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54\% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28\%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76\% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.
INTERPRETATION: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

	annote = {Four approaches to estimating a regression model for relative survival using the method of maximum likelihood are described and compared. The underlying model is an additive hazards model where the total hazard is written as the sum of the known baseline hazard and the excess hazard associated with a diagnosis of cancer. The excess hazards are assumed to be constant within pre-specified bands of follow-up. The likelihood can be maximized directly or in the framework of generalized linear models. Minor differences exist due to, for example, the way the data are presented (individual, aggregated or grouped), and in some assumptions (e.g. distributional assumptions). The four approaches are applied to two real data sets and produce very similar estimates even when the assumption of proportional excess hazards is violated. The choice of approach to use in practice can, therefore, be guided by ease of use and availability of software. We recommend using a generalized linear model with a Poisson error structure based on collapsed data using exact survival times. The model can be estimated in any software package that estimates GLMs with user-defined link functions (including SAS, Stata, S-plus, and R) and utilizes the theory of generalized linear models for assessing goodness-of-fit and studying regression diagnostics.}

DESIGN: Cohort study involving nation-wide linkage of HIV, AIDS and cancer registry data. METHODS: Association of cancer risk with immune deficiency was examined by analysing cancer risks in four periods between HIV diagnosis, AIDS and death. RESULTS: Linkage identified 196 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer in 8351 people notified with HIV infection and 8118 registered with AIDS (total of 13 067 individuals). Overall, we found significantly increased rates of cancer of the lip, anus, Hodgkin's disease, myeloma and leukaemia. Of these cancers, in people with HIV infection who did not develop AIDS, or were more than 5 years prior to development of AIDS, only cancer of the anus occurred at increased rates. A significant trend of increasing relative risk of cancer with increasing time since HIV diagnosis was found for Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: People with HIV with mild immune deficiency prior to AIDS were at increased risk of anal cancer, but this may reflect other risk factors. Other cancers occurred only later in the course of HIV infection. This is reassuring evidence that people with HIV who are only mildly immune deficient may not be at increased risk of non-AIDS-defining cancers, but larger studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to confirm this},

METHODS: We intensely followed all 336 antiretroviral-naive patients attending the Goethe Universitat Clinic who began multi-drug combination regimens and in whom a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml was achieved within 24 weeks, in order to assess the risk of viral load rebound. Inspection of case notes allowed the distinction of viral rebound according to whether there was an associated complete interruption of therapy. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients experienced viral rebound during 543.1 person-years of follow-up, giving a 25.3\% risk of rebound by 3.3 years from first achieving viral suppression. However, for 47 of the patients with viral rebound there was an associated documented complete interruption of antiretroviral therapy, mostly as a result of co-morbidities, leaving 14 who appear to represent a failure of the virological efficacy of therapy (viral breakthrough; 5.2\% risk by 3.3 years). The risk of viral breakthrough declined with the increased duration of suppression (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The intrinsic virological effectiveness of multi-drug antiretroviral therapy in previously drug-naive individuals appears to be such that viral suppression, once achieved, can be maintained for several years in patients not interrupting therapy. The major challenge is to develop regimens that can be taken consistently and safely for such long periods of time},

To document rates and trends in mortality and provide recommendations for political and humanitarian interventions, we did a nationwide mortality survey during April-July, 2004. METHODS: We used a stratified three-stage, household-based cluster sampling technique. Of 511 health zones, 49 were excluded because of insecurity, and four were purposely selected to allow historical comparisons. From the remainder, probability of selection was proportional to population size. Geographical distribution and size of cluster determined how households were selected: systematic random or classic proximity sampling. Heads of households were asked about all deaths of household members during January, 2003, to April, 2004. FINDINGS: 19,500 households were visited. The national crude mortality rate of 2.1 deaths per 1000 per month (95\% CI 1.6-2.6) was 40\% higher than the sub-Saharan regional level (1.5), corresponding to 600,000 more deaths than would be expected during the recall period and 38,000 excess deaths per month. Total death toll from the conflict (1998-2004) was estimated to be 3.9 million. Mortality rate was higher in unstable eastern provinces, showing the effect of insecurity. Most deaths were from easily preventable and treatable illnesses rather than violence. Regression analysis suggested that if the effects of violence were removed, all-cause mortality could fall to almost normal rates. INTERPRETATION: The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains the world's deadliest humanitarian crisis. To save lives, improvements in security and increased humanitarian assistance are urgently needed.}

This study aimed to examine trends in the age-specific and age-standardised cancer mortality rates and numbers of cancer deaths up to 2020 for all cancers and various specific sites for all 15 EU countries, the 10 acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania (currently applicant countries, along with Turkey), and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland of the four EEA countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mortality rates were modelled as a function of age, calendar period and birth cohort. Birth cohort was calculated as age subtracted from calendar period. RESULTS: As a consequence of the generally decreasing trends in the age-standardised rates, the best estimate is that there will be approximately 1.25 million cancer deaths in 2015, which is almost 130,000 (11\%) more deaths than in 2000, but 155,000 (11\%) fewer deaths than the 1.4 million projected in 2015 on the basis of demographic changes alone. The increases in the forecast numbers of cancer deaths in 2015 are proportionally larger in males than in females (13\% and 10\%, respectively) and proportionally larger in the acceding countries than in the current EU member countries (14\% and 11\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our forecasts are conservative best estimates of future cancer mortality. There is clearly scope for large improvements in survival, and hence reductions in cancer mortality, in some countries, through eliminating these differences using existing knowledge and treatment regimes.}

	annote = {In a cohort of 6502 male and 410 female former workers from the crocidolite (blue asbestos) mining and milling works at Wittenoom, Western Australia, there were 94 cases of malignant mesothelioma (12 cases of peritoneal mesothelioma), 141 cases of lung cancer and 356 successful compensation claims for asbestosis to the end of 1986. After adjusting for measured covariate effects by means of proportional hazards regression analysis, smooth curves were fitted to the resulting "underlying" incidence rates for malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis, separately, and for mortality of any cause. By the use of these curves and individual risk estimates, predictions have been made of the future incidence of these diseases to the year 2020. With the assumption that all subjects who were not known to be dead or departed overseas still were alive at December 31, 1986, and excluding persons of more than 85 years of age, the number of new cases of mesothelioma is expected to rise to a peak of around 25 cases per year in 2010, with an expected total number of 692 cases of mesothelioma (95\% confidence interval [CI], 394-990 cases) between 1987 and 2020. A total of 2898 deaths (95\% CI, 2284-3511 deaths) of any cause is expected in the same period. New cases of lung cancer and asbestosis are expected to continue at roughly the current rates of eight and 17 cases per year, respectively, before declining after the year 2000, leading to totals of 183 cases (95\% CI, 34-335 cases) and 482 cases (95\% CI, 236-728 cases), respectively, being expected by the year 2020. Predictions that were based on the censoring of subjects at the date that they last were known to be alive resulted in slightly higher, but probably less accurate, estimates.}

METHODS: The estimates were obtained with the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures using mortality and relative survival data. Published survival data from the Italian cancer registries were appropriately modelled in order to estimate survival at regional and national level. RESULTS: For men, the Italian lung cancer mortality and incidence rates reached their maximum values during the late 1980s and steeply decreased thereafter. This pattern is quite uniform across all regions, even though the decrease was delayed and less steep in the South of the country. For women, both indicators appear to be increasing at the national level, even though a certain regional variability in incidence trends remains within the country: some regions (such as Lazio, Umbria, Marche, Campania, Sardegna and Friuli Venezia Giulia) present increasing trends, while in others a clear levelling off is visible. A total of 33,500 incident cases, 72,000 prevalent cases and 28,000 deaths are estimated in Italy in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: This study produced an up-to-date description of lung cancer epidemiology both at national and regional level. The marked difference in lung cancer figures and trends between sexes suggests that prevention policies have led to changes in smoking habits for men, while for women they were lacking in efficacy. The attention should now focus on women, whose risk trend is the least favorable.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world. One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA); however, the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate. METHODS: In December, 1994, 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944, randomly sampled from the population register, were randomised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years (n=10,000) or to a control group not invited (n=10,000). Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit (median 69, range 67-71 years) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies. The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality, analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle. The study is ongoing, with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing. This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31, 2008. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial ISRCTN54449243. FINDINGS: In each group, 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the randomisation date, or prevalent prostate cancer. In men randomised to screening, 7578 (76\%) of 9952 attended at least once. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group were diagnosed with prostate cancer, resulting in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7\% in the screening group and 8.2\% in the control group (hazard ratio 1.64; 95\% CI 1.50-1.80; p{\textless}0.0001). The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40\% (95\% CI 0.17-0.64), from 0.90\% in the control group to 0.50\% in the screening group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 (95\% CI 0.39-0.82; p=0.002) in the screening compared with the control group. The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 (95\% CI 0.28-0.68; p=0.0002). Overall, 293 (95\% CI 177-799) men needed to be invited for screening and 12 to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death. INTERPRETATION: This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years. However, the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes. The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs.

Suicide data were stratified for the period 1979-2003 by metropolitan, rural and remote areas and examined across five quinquennia, centred on each Australian census from 1981 to 2001. Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth and the mediating effects of area SES, using Poisson regression models. Male suicide rates in metropolitan, rural and remote areas diverged significantly over time, especially in young males (15-24 years). Young male suicide rates increased significantly in metropolitan, rural and remote areas over 1979-1998, and in the most recent period (1999-2003) increased further in remote areas from 38.8 (per 100,000) to 47.9 (23\% increase). In contrast suicide rates in rural areas decreased from a peak of 27.5 to 19.8 (28\% decrease), and in metropolitan areas from a peak of 22.1 to 16.8 (24\% decrease). Similar divergence in the 1999-2003 quinquennium, though of a lesser magnitude, was also evident for males aged 25-34 years. Female suicide rates in the earlier part of the period were significantly lower in rural and remote areas than in metropolitan areas, particularly for those aged 25-34 years, then increased in rural and remote areas to converge with female suicide rates in metropolitan areas. Adjusting for SES in addition to age and country-of-birth reduced urban-rural suicide differentials in both males and females, consistent with SES being an intermediary between rural residence and suicide. Nevertheless, urban-rural differences remained statistically significant. These results show that the largest urban-rural male suicide differentials for the 25-year study period occurred in the most recent period (1999-2003), in the context of decreasing male suicide rates overall.}

Rates should be considered as observations in a Lexis diagram, and tabulation a necessary reduction of data, which should be as small as possible, and age, period and cohort should be treated as continuous variables. Reporting should include the absolute level of the rates as part of the age-effects. This paper gives a guide to analysis of rates from a Lexis diagram by the age-period-cohort model. Three aspects are considered separately: (1) tabulation of cases and person-years; (2) modelling of age, period and cohort effects; and (3) parametrization and reporting of the estimated effects. It is argued that most of the confusion in the literature comes from failure to make a clear distinction between these three aspects. A set of recommendations for the practitioner is given and a package for R that implements the recommendations is introduced.}

Little data exist on the use of these tests for serial PSA screening. We compared serial total PSA, the free-to-total PSA ratio and calculated complexed PSA in men diagnosed with prostate cancer and matched controls in a population based study.Materials and Methods: We identified 90 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1988 and 1996 with at least 3 serial serum samples obtained at 2-year intervals who were participants in the beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial for the prevention of lung cancer. Samples were available up to 10 years before diagnosis. A total of 90 age matched men from the same cohort without prostate carcinoma were identified as controls. Free and total PSA was measured by the Abbott AxSYM system.Results: Baseline demographics of cases and controls were similar. At baseline and diagnosis the men with prostate cancer had higher total and complexed PSA, and a lower free-to-total PSA ratio than controls. Mean followup was 5.2 years in cases and 5.5 in controls. The yearly change in PSA parameters in cases versus controls was 20.7\% versus 3.5\% for total, -3.4\% versus 0.2\% for free-to-total and 21.5\% versus 3.4\% for complexed PSA (p {\textless}0.0001). At diagnosis PSA alone was estimated to perform with more than 90\% specificity in our model.Conclusions: In this population based study total PSA was superior to the free-to-total PSA ratio for predicting the development of prostate cancer. While serial changes in free-to-total PSA ratios with time were statistically significantly different in men diagnosed with prostate cancer and controls, the magnitude of these serial changes were slight enough to render them clinically insignificant.}

In a cohort study of miners and millers only two pleural cancers were reported, a finding considered to indicate that chrysotile has a low potency for inducing mesothelioma. However, follow-up ended in 1987 and white-collar workers and the employees of subcontractors were not studied. METHODS: To complete the case ascertainment, the study searched the Registry of Malignant Mesotheliomas of Piedmont for records of cases of pleural mesothelioma among the following: mine employees; employees of subcontractors or of other firms transporting or refining Balangero asbestos, asbestos ore or mine tailings; individuals exposed to air pollution from the mine or living with mine employees; and individuals exposed to mine tailings from Balangero. RESULTS: The study identified four new cases of pleural mesothelioma among blue-collar workers in the mine, in addition to the two reported in the cohort study. Thus, six mesotheliomas occurred, compared to the 1.5 expected (p{\textless}0.01). The study also identified three mesothelioma cases among white-collar employees at the mine, five in workers in the mine hired by subcontracting firms, and three among workers processing Balangero chrysotile outside the mine. Finally, 10 additional cases due to non-occupational exposure or exposure to re-used mine tailings were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of 14 mesothelioma cases among workers who were active in the mine and 13 among other people exposed to Balangero chrysotile provides further evidence that tremolite-free chrysotile is carcinogenic.},

A seemingly unrelated problem in epidemiology is that of confounding: bias in estimation of the effects of an exposure on disease risk, due to inherent differences in risk between exposed and unexposed individuals. Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to collapsibility-based definitions.}

In the second example, multiple doses of N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) were administered to rats in their drinking water and quantitative information on ATPase deficient foci in the liver recorded at various times. Additionally, a separate group of animals, administered the same doses, was followed until death and the presence or absence of malignant liver tumors recorded. The parameters of the model were estimated by fitting the model to these data and the estimated parameters were used to construct a dose-response curve for the probability of malignant tumors. Few malignant tumors were observed at the lower doses; however, the information on ATPase deficient foci can be used in the model to extend the range of the dose-response curve below the doses at which malignant tumors are observed.}

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A survival analysis of all patients with cancers diagnosed in NSW between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1996. Survival was determined to 31 December 1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relative excess risk (RER) of death over 5 years was estimated for each geographic remoteness category relative to the highly accessible category for 20 cancer types adjusted for age, sex, years since diagnosis and, subsequently, stage of cancer at diagnosis. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the RER of death across remoteness categories (P {\textless} 0.001) for cancers of the cervix and prostate and for all cancers. The RERs for the most remote categories (compared with the highly accessible category) before and after adjustment for stage were cervix, 3.22 (95\% CI, 1.54-6.75) and 2.25 (95\% CI, 1.06-4.77); prostate, 3.38 (95\% CI, 2.21-5.16) and 2.53 (95\% CI, 1.60-4.01); all cancers, 1.35 (95\% CI, 1.20-1.51) and 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.11-1.41). In addition, there were significant variations in RER of death by remoteness for head and neck, lung and colon cancers and cutaneous melanoma. CONCLUSION: Cancer survival varies by remoteness of residence in NSW for all cancers together and some cancers individually. Access to screening or early diagnosis probably contributes to this variation, but persistence after adjustment for stage suggests that treatment variation is also important.}

Corresponding rates in women varied from 0.1/100 000 to 0.2/100 000 between 1968 and 1980, then rose to 0.3/100 000 in 1983. The rise in MMP mortality in men probably corresponds to the increasing use of asbestos, particularly amosite, in Australia during and after World War II. That production and importation of amosite and crocidolite in Australia reached a peak in 1958 may mean that peak mortality from MMP will not be reached until the 1990s (allowing a 35-year lag period). Substantial increases in importation and later production, of chrysotile in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s may lead to increases in the incidence of other asbestos-related cancers, not reflected in trends in the incidence of MMP.}

METHODS: The unit record data for females were extracted from the two NHSs and combined. The outcome variable of interest was 'having a Pap test in the past three years'. The principal study factor was SES measured as individual characteristics and SES of area of residence. Migrant status, rurality, year of survey and age were controlled for in logistic regression models. RESULTS: Self-reported rates of having a Pap test in the past three years were higher in women from higher compared with lower SES groups. Compared with women with a bachelor or higher degree, the odds of reporting having a Pap test in the past three years in women with no post-school qualification was 0.86 (p{\textless}0.0005). Women with a gross annual income of less than \$20,000 had significantly lower odds (OR=0.79) compared with women earning \$40,000 or more. Blue collar (OR=0.84) and not employed (OR=0.73) women also had significantly lower odds compared to the referent white collar group. CONCLUSION: This study reveals differentials in Pap screening behaviour by individual measures of SES in Australia. Area-based SES measures under-estimated the SES differentials in Pap test rates compared with individual measures. Derived population attributable fractions reveal that about a quarter of self-reported under-screening is accounted for by low SES when measured individually, compared to 8\% when SES is measured ecologically.}

New diagnostic and screening tests must be evaluated based on their abilities to discriminate diseased from nondiseased states. The partial area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a measure of diagnostic test accuracy. We present an interpretation of the partial area under the curve (AUC), which gives rise to a nonparametric estimator. This estimator is more robust than existing estimators, which make parametric assumptions. We show that the robustness is gained with only a moderate loss in efficiency. We describe a regression modeling framework for making inference about covariate effects on the partial AUC. Such models can refine knowledge about test accuracy. Model parameters can be estimated using binary regression methods. We use the regression framework to compare two prostate-specific antigen biomarkers and to evaluate the dependence of biomarker accuracy on the time prior to clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.},

MAMS trials provide earlier answers and are potentially more cost-effective than a series of traditionally designed trials. Prostate cancer is the most common tumour in men and there is a need to improve outcomes for men with hormone-sensitive, advanced disease as quickly as possible. The MAMS design will potentially facilitate evaluation and testing of new therapies in this and other diseases. METHODS: STAMPEDE is an open-label, 5-stage, 6-arm randomised controlled trial using MAMS methodology for men with prostate cancer. It is the first trial of this design to use multiple arms and stages synchronously. RESULTS: The practical and statistical issues faced by STAMPEDE in implementing MAMS methodology are discussed and contrasted with those for traditional trials. These issues include the choice of intermediate and final outcome measures, sample size calculations and the impact of varying the assumptions, the process for moving between trial stages, stopping accrual to each trial arm and overall, and issues around perceived trial complexity. CONCLUSION: It is possible to use the MAMS design to initiate and undertake large scale cancer trials. The results from STAMPEDE will not be known for some years but the lessons learned from running a MAMS trial are shared in the hope that other researchers will use this exciting and efficient method to perform further randomised controlled trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer model of disease progression, clinical diagnosis, PSA growth and PSA screening was used. Under baseline conditions, when screening is not considered, the model replicates clinical diagnosis and disease mortality rates recorded by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute in the mid 1980s. RESULTS: Biannual screening with PSA greater than 4.0 ng./ml. was projected to reduce the number of screens and false-positive tests by almost 50\% relative to annual screening while retaining 93\% of years of life saved. With annual screening use of an age specific bound for PSA to consider a test positive instead of the standard 4.0 ng./ml. was projected to reduce false-positive screens by 27\% and over diagnosis by a third while retaining almost 95\% of years of life saved. Sensitivity analyses did not change the relative efficacy of biannual screening. CONCLUSIONS: Under the model assumptions biannual PSA screening is a cost-effective alternative to annual PSA screening for prostate cancer. With annual screening use of an age specific bound for PSA positivity appears to reduce false-positive results and over diagnosis rates sharply relative to a bound of 4 ng./ml. while retaining most of the survival benefits.}

These are naturally formulated within the framework of hierarchical models, and over the past decade, a variety of spatial models have been proposed for the latent level(s) of the hierarchy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main classes of such models that have been used for disease mapping within a Bayesian estimation paradigm, and report a performance comparison between representative models in these classes, using a set of simulated data to help illustrate their respective properties. We also consider recent extensions to model the joint spatial distribution of multiple disease or health indicators. The aim is to help the reader choose an appropriate structural prior for the second level of the hierarchical model and to discuss issues of sensitivity to this choice.}

Overall, there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons alive with cancer (within three years of diagnosis). The most commonly diagnosed cancers are lung (1.35 million), breast (1.15 million), and colorectal (1 million); the most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.18 million deaths), stomach cancer (700,000 deaths), and liver cancer (598,000 deaths). The most prevalent cancer in the world is breast cancer (4.4 million survivors up to 5 years following diagnosis). There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors related to lifestyle or environment, and provides a clear challenge to prevention.},

The usefulness of these screening mechanisms is not well established, however. A meta-analysis of PSA and DRE to detect prostate carcinoma was conducted with a focus on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. METHODS: A literature search of OVID database (1966 to November 1999) using the medical subject headings "prostate-specific antigen" and "mass screening," as well as "prostate carcinoma," was performed. Thirteen articles were selected for the meta-analysis in this study. Most studies included asymptomatic men older than 50 years from various countries. Pooled results were calculated from the individual reports for sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for PSA and DRE based on biopsy result as the reference standard. RESULTS: The overall detection rate of prostate carcinoma was 1.8\% based on a positive biopsy. Of the prostate carcinoma detected, 83.4\% was localized. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for PSA were 72.1\%, 93.2\% and 25.1\%, respectively; and for DRE were 53.2\%, 83.6\% and 17.8\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were two major outcomes of this meta-analysis. One was the potential for detecting early-stage prostate cancer with these screening tests, because 83.4\% of total cancers detected were localized. The second important outcome was that the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for PSA were higher than those for DRE when used as a screening tool to detect prostate cancer. When a patient has abnormal findings using PSA and DRE, the chance of cancer is 1 in 4 or 5. Conversely, when findings from PSA and DRE are normal, the chance of missing a cancer is about 10\%.}

We find the number of significant joinpoints by performing several permutation tests, each of which has a correct significance level asymptotically. Each p-value is found using Monte Carlo methods, and the overall asymptotic significance level is maintained through a Bonferroni correction. These tests are extended to the situation with non-constant variance to handle rates with Poisson variation and possibly autocorrelated errors. The performance of these tests are studied via simulations and the tests are applied to U.S. prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates.}

Eighteen cases of effusion, determined from clinical records to be caused by malignant pleural mesothelioma, were seen by reader 1 and 20 by reader 2. The latent periods between commencing work and the first radiograph showing effusion were much shorter for subjects with benign asbestos pleural effusion than for subjects with effusion due to malignant pleural mesothelioma, although there was considerable overlap in the range. The longest latent period for benign asbestos pleural effusion was 22 years and the shortest period for effusion due to malignant pleural mesothelioma was 12 years. The latent period for benign asbestos pleural effusion was inversely related to total cumulative exposure, whereas that for effusion due to malignant pleural mesothelioma was significantly shorter for subjects who had worked in the mill than for those who had worked in the mine. A long latent period and a history of working in the mill were significant discriminators for a malignant as opposed to a benign basis for an effusion. The appearance of a benign asbestos pleural effusion appeared to be a risk factor for the severity of subsequent diffuse pleural thickening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

DESIGN: Cohort of HIV-infected patients from two trials of lamivudine therapy. PATIENTS: For 620 patients randomized in the North American NUCA3001 and NUCA3002 trials of lamivudine, HIV RNA levels were measured (median, seven measures per patient) and CD4 counts were assessed at a central laboratory (median, 13 counts per patient). Patients were in the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stages A (n = 439), B (n = 135) or C (n = 46) at baseline. OUTCOME MEASURES: For patients who were in CDC stage A at baseline we considered the ability of HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts to predict the development of CDC stage B or C disease. A Cox proportional hazards model was used. In a second analysis, patients who were AIDS-free at baseline were considered, and the endpoint was AIDS (CDC stage C). RESULTS: Patients' initial CD4 counts ranged (5-95\% centiles) from 104 to 529 x 10(6)/l (median, 274 x 10(6)/l) and HIV RNA levels from 1900 to 339680 copies/ml (median, 44240 copies/ml). For the first analysis, with CDC stage B or C disease as endpoint, both the most recent HIV RNA level and CD4 count predicted the development of clinical disease [relative hazard (RH) for HIV RNA, 1.96 per 10-fold difference in HIV RNA; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.41-2.73; P = 0.0001; and RH for CD4 count, 1.82 per twofold difference in CD4 count; 95\% CI, 1.27-2.56; P = 0.0009]. When both HIV RNA and CD4 count were included in a multiple regression model, both markers provided information additional to that given by the other (RH for HIV RNA, 1.75; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.50; P = 0.002; and RH for CD4 count, 1.40; 95\% CI, 0.95-2.07; P = 0.09). In the second analysis, with AIDS as endpoint, both HIV RNA level (P = 0.02) and CD4 count (P = 0.004) were independently associated with clinical progression. These results were essentially unchanged after adjustment for treatment arm (zidovudine/lamivudine versus control arms). CONCLUSION: The HIV RNA level shows ability to predict the development of clinical disease and may thus be of importance in addition to the CD4 count in patient monitoring},

This study examines the effectiveness of adjuvant ADT combined with radiotherapy for a wide range of patients treated in the 1990s. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Prostate cancer survival was examined in a population based cohort of 31,643 patients aged 65 to 85 years who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and treated with external beam radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy. Instrumental variable analysis methods were used to control for selection bias. RESULTS: Patients with stage T3/T4 disease who received adjuvant ADT experienced improved 5-year and 8-year survival. No survival advantage was observed for men with T1/T2 disease during this interval. CONCLUSION: High-risk patients who receive primary radiotherapy have benefited from adjuvant ADT, whereas low-risk patients with disease confined to the prostate have not yet benefited from adjuvant therapy within the first 8 years after treatment. These findings are consistent with practice guidelines, which recommend adjuvant ADT for patients with high-risk disease.}

Data were generated from 8,100 population structures at each of several sample sizes. The performance of the different strategies was evaluated by computing bias, mean squared error, and coverage rates of confidence intervals. At least one variation of each strategy that was examined performed acceptably. The change-in-estimate and equivalence-test-of-the-difference strategies performed best when the cut-point for deciding whether crude and adjusted estimates differed by an important amount was set to a low value (10\%). The significance test strategies performed best when the alpha level was set to much higher than conventional levels (0.20).}

We determined the virological and immunological characteristics of a cohort of long-term nonprogressors in Australia and examined the role of these factors in predicting disease progression. Individuals with documented asymptomatic HIV-1 infection for at least 8 years with CD4+ lymphocyte counts {\textgreater}500 cells/microl were recruited from hospital clinics and general practices serving the eastern area of Australia. CD4+ lymphocyte count, rate of CD4+ lymphocyte change, CD8+ lymphocyte count, beta2-microglobulin, immune complex dissociated (ICD) HIV-1 p24 antigen, and plasma HIV-1 RNA were measured at baseline and multiple visits at 6-month intervals over an average period of 2 years. Up to November 1996, 67 study participants were recruited, of whom 72\% had been infected with HIV-1 for at least 10 years. HIV-1 RNA correlated with beta2-microglobulin, ICD p24 antigen, and the ability to isolate virus in culture but not with levels of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes. Serum beta2-microglobulin was a stronger predictor of CD4+ lymphocyte decline than HIV-1 RNA and the only factor significantly associated with CD4+ lymphocyte decline. These findings show that the serum concentration of beta2-microglobulin is a strong predictor of immunological progression in people with long- term asymptomatic HIV-1 infection and provides additional prognostic information to HIV-1 RNA in determining the risk of disease progression},

No proven therapy exists for lipoatrophy, but abacavir is a nucleoside analog that may be less toxic to mitochondria. OBJECTIVE: To determine if substitution of stavudine or zidovudine with abacavir improves HIV lipoatrophy without affecting control of HIV replication. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label 24-week study. SETTING: Seventeen hospital HIV outpatient clinics and primary care centers in Australia and England, with randomization from June 2000 through January 2001. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 111 adults (109 men) with moderate or severe lipoatrophy who were receiving stavudine (n = 85) or zidovudine (n = 26) and had stable plasma HIV RNA levels below 400 copies/mL and no prior abacavir therapy. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to switch from stavudine or zidovudine to abacavir, 300 mg twice per day, while continuing all other antiretroviral therapy (n = 54) or to continue all antiretroviral therapy (n = 57). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was limb fat mass, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; key secondary end points were plasma HIV RNA levels, adverse events, physician- assessed (via subjective measures) lipodystrophy severity, total and central fat mass, and fasting metabolic (lipid, glycemic, and lactate) levels. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in limb fat in the abacavir group relative to the stavudine/zidovudine group (0.39 vs 0.08 kg; mean difference, 0.31; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.57 kg), as well as significant relative increases in subcutaneous thigh (P =.01), arm (P{\textless}.001), and abdominal (P =.001) fat areas on computed tomography. Switching had no significant effect on secondary end points, including plasma HIV RNA (for unadjusted comparison between groups at week 24, odds ratio, 1.38; 95\% CI, 0.48-3.96). Change in limb fat mass at week 24 did not correlate with change in subjectively determined perceived lipoatrophy severity (r = -0.06; P =.53 by Spearman correlation). Hypersensitivity to abacavir was seen in 5 patients (10\%). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of lipoatrophic HIV- infected adults, switching from stavudine or zidovudine to abacavir for 24 weeks led to significant, albeit modest, objectively measured increases in limb fat. Clinical lipoatrophy, as assessed subjectively, did not resolve, however, and at the rate of increase observed may take years to resolve with use of this strategy. Longer-term follow-up is needed},

RESULTS: Risk factors associated with an increased risk of preterm birth after controlling for potential confounders included smoking during pregnancy (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 2.7, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3, 5.4), and multiple birth (adjusted RR = 48.8, 95\% CI = 18.1, 131.4).

Alcohol intake in third trimester was associated with a reduced risk of preterm birth (adjusted RR = 0.4, 95\% CI = 0.2, 0.7). CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking and multiple births were the most important modifiable risk factors in this study for preterm birth and may contribute to 17\% and 11\% of preterm births respectively.}

METHODS AND RESULTS: Rates of admission for AMI before the ban (October-December 2004) and during the ban (February-June 2005) were analysed. Each period was compared with the corresponding period 12 months before. Among persons aged under 60, the number of admissions for AMI decreased significantly after the introduction of the ban: from 922 cases in February-June 2004 to 832 cases in February-June 2005 (sex- and age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.81-0.98). No decrease was seen before the ban. No effect was found among persons aged at least 60. We estimated that the observed reduction in active smoking after the introduction of the ban could account for a 0.7\% decrease in admissions for AMI during the study period, suggesting that most of the observed effect (11\%) might be due to the reduction of passive smoking. CONCLUSION: Our study, based on a population of about 4 million inhabitants, suggests that smoke-free policies may result in a short-term reduction in admissions for AMI.},

	annote = {Whilst the prognostic value of serum beta-2 microglobulin (s-beta 2m) is well documented, the lack of a simple strategy for its use means that it is rarely ever measured in clinical practice. The prognosis associated with s-beta 2m at two different points in HIV infection, as defined by the CD4 count, was studied in a cohort of 111 men with haemophilia registered at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London. At CD4 counts of 0.5 and 0.2 x 10(9)/l, a raised s-beta 2m level was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing AIDS (P = 0.002 and 0.022 respectively, adjusted for the patient's age). Kaplan-Meier progression rates to AIDS by 4.5 years after a CD4 count of 0.5 x 10(9)/l were 57\% (95\% CI 32-82\%) in those with s-beta 2m levels of 3 mg/l or more, but 20\% (95\% CI 4-36\%) in those with s-beta 2m levels of less than 3 mg/l. By 3.5 years after a CD4 count of 0.2 x 10(9)/l, Kaplan-Meier progression rates to AIDS were 75\% (95\% CI 52-98\%) in those with s-beta 2m levels of 3.8 mg/l or more, and 47\% (95\% CI 29-66\%) in those with s-beta 2m levels of less than 3.8 mg/l. In the absence of acute viral infections, a raised s-beta 2m indicates those who will tend to progress to AIDS more rapidly than those with lower s-beta 2m levels and the same CD4 count. S-beta 2m levels in general are likely to be higher in haemophilia patients than in other, non-haemophilic risk groups. Whilst care should be taken, therefore, when applying our chosen cut-off values to non-haemophilic patients, our findings support the introduction of prophylaxis and antiviral therapies at a higher CD4 count in those with raised s-beta 2m levels relative to other patients in the same risk group whilst delaying treatment in those with lower CD4 counts, but relatively normal s-beta 2m levels}

We conducted a population-based case-control study of the association between marijuana use and the risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers in Los Angeles. METHODS: Our study included 1,212 incident cancer cases and 1,040 cancer-free controls matched to cases on age, gender, and neighborhood. Subjects were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. The cumulative use of marijuana was expressed in joint-years, where 1 joint-year is equivalent to smoking one joint per day for 1 year. RESULTS: Although using marijuana for {\textgreater} or =30 joint-years was positively associated in the crude analyses with each cancer type (except pharyngeal cancer), no positive associations were observed when adjusting for several confounders including cigarette smoking. The adjusted odds ratio estimate (and 95\% confidence limits) for {\textgreater} or =60 versus 0 joint-years was 1.1 (0.56, 2.1) for oral cancer, 0.84 (0.28, 2.5) for laryngeal cancer, and 0.62 (0.32, 1.2) for lung cancer; the adjusted odds ratio estimate for {\textgreater} or =30 versus 0 joint-years was 0.57 (0.20, 1.6) for pharyngeal cancer, and 0.53 (0.22, 1.3) for esophageal cancer. No association was consistently monotonic across exposure categories, and restriction to subjects who never smoked cigarettes yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may have been affected by selection bias or error in measuring lifetime exposure and confounder histories; but they suggest that the association of these cancers with marijuana, even long-term or heavy use, is not strong and may be below practically detectable limits.}

An increase in cell proliferation rates leads to an increase in mutation rates per unit of time, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the risk of cancer. An increase in cell division rates relative to death or differentiation rates may lead to an increase in the population of critical target cells, which, again, leads to an increase in cancer risk. These fundamental principles are well illustrated by the rodent liver model for carcinogenesis. In this paper, we shall briefly discuss some of the consequences of incorporating cell proliferation kinetics into quantitative models of cancer risk assessment. Consideration of cell kinetics can shed light on apparently paradoxical observations such as, e.g. the observation that the administration of two different promoters may lead to the same volume fraction in the rodent liver, with one promoter giving rise to a large number of small foci, and the other to a small number of large foci. Some consequences of explicitly considering cell proliferation kinetics in malignant foci are briefly discussed.}

This paper reviews and discusses ecologic biases induced by model misspecification; confounding; non-additivity of exposure and covariate effects (effect modification); exposure misclassification; and non-comparable standardization. Ecologic estimates can be more sensitive to these sources of bias than individual-level estimates, primarily because ecologic estimates are based on extrapolations to an unobserved conditional (individual-level) distribution. Because of this sensitivity, one should not rely on a single regression model for an ecologic analysis. Valid ecologic estimates are most feasible when one can obtain accurate estimates of exposure and covariate means in regions with internal exposure homogeneity and mutual covariate comparability; thus, investigators should seek out such regions in the design and analysis of ecologic studies.}

Thus, according to the model, at least for alpha-particle radiation from inhaled radon daughters, lung cancer induction over long periods of protracted irradiation appears to be dominated by radiation-induced modification of the proliferation kinetics of already-initiated cells rather than by direct radiation-induced (i.e., mutation) of normal cells. We explore the possible consequences of this result for radiation exposures to space travellers on long missions. Still unknown is the LET dependence of this effect. Speculations of the cause of this phenomenon include the suggestion that modification of cell kinetics is caused by a "bystander" effect, i.e., the traversal of normal cells by alpha particles, followed by the signaling of these cells to nearby initiated cells which then modify their proliferation kinetics.

INTERVENTIONS--26 asymptomatic patients started taking zidovudine or placebo (1000 mg/day) during November 1988 to February 1990; 10 patients with CD4+ counts of 0.2 x 10(9)/l started zidovudine 500 mg/day during January to November 1990. 35 patients used pentamidine for primary or secondary prophylaxis. RESULTS--At 11 years from seroconversion the estimated rate of progression to AIDS was 42\% (95\% confidence interval 27\% to 57\%); to symptoms 85\% (75\% to 95\%); and to death 41\% (25\% to 57\%). Progression to AIDS was significantly faster in patients aged 25 and over than in those aged less than 25 (relative risk 5.0 (2.4 to 10.4); p less than 0.00001) and in those with previous cytomegalovirus infection than in those not infected (relative risk 3.0 (1.4 to 6.8); p = 0.006). 16 of 27 (59\%) patients with p24 antigenaemia developed AIDS compared with 17 of 84 (20\%) patients without p24 antigen (p less than 0.001). The risk of progression to AIDS before 30 November 1988 in patients with CD4+ counts less than or equal to 0.2 x 10(9)/l was higher than after November 1988 (relative risk 1.9 (0.85 to 4.43); p = 0.1). For 1989 and 1990 the observed cumulative numbers of AIDS cases (among 81 patients with sufficient CD4+ counts) were 22 and 25 compared with 29 and 37 predicted from the rate of fall of CD4+ counts up to the end of 1988 (p = 0.03).

In a small number of patients, a delayed or absent rebound in plasma virus load has been noted after drug cessation, apparently associated with prior drug interruptions and autologous boosting of HIV-1 specific immune responses. We hypothesized that cyclic structured treatment interruptions structured treatment interruptions (STI) could augment HIV-1 specific immune responses in chronic HIV-1 infection, which might help to control HIV-1 replication off therapy. METHODS: We initiated an STI pilot study in 10 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 chronically infected subjects with baseline CD4 T-cell counts {\textgreater} 500 x 10(6) cells/l and plasma viral load {\textgreater} 5000 copies/ml who received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for 1 year with good response (plasma viral load {\textless} 20 copies/ml for at least 32 weeks). Three cycles of HAART interruption were performed. RESULTS: In all of the patients viral load rebounded, but doubling times increased significantly between the first and third stops (P = 0.008), and by the third stop, six out of nine subjects had a virological set-point after a median 12 months off therapy that was lower than baseline before starting HAART (ranging from 0.6 log(10) to 1.3 log(10) lower than baseline) and in four it remained stable below 5000 copies/ml. Those subjects who controlled viral replication developed significantly stronger HIV-1 specific cellular immune responses than subjects lacking spontaneous decline (P {\textless} 0.05). During viral rebounds no genotypic or phenotypic changes conferring resistance to reverse trancriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors was detected, but mean absolute CD4 T-cell counts declined significantly, although never below 450 x 10(6)/l and the mean value at 12 months off therapy was significantly higher than the pre-treatment level (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that STI in chronic HIV-1 infection might augment HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses associated with a spontaneous and sustained drop in plasma viral load in some subjects but at the potential cost of lower CD4 T-cell counts.}

Conversely, individual-level survey data often have insufficient power to study small-area variations in health. Such problems can be reduced by supplementing the aggregate-level data with small samples of data from individuals within the areas, which directly link exposures and outcomes. We outline a hierarchical model framework for estimating individual-level associations using a combination of aggregate and individual data. We perform a comprehensive simulation study, under a variety of realistic conditions, to determine when aggregate data are sufficient for accurate inference, and when we also require individual-level information.

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Annual Pap smear screening has been favored over less frequent screening in the United States to minimize the risk of cervical cancer. We evaluated whether simultaneous screening with a Pap test and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful for assessing the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cervical cancer. METHODS: We enrolled 23 702 subjects in a study of HPV infection at Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Division, Portland, OR. Data were analyzed for 20 810 volunteers who were at least 16 years old (mean = 35.9 years) with satisfactory baseline Pap tests and suitable samples for HPV testing. Women were followed for up to 122 months (from April 1, 1989, to June 30, 1999) to determine the risk for histopathologically confirmed CIN3 or cancer. RESULTS: Among 171 women with CIN3 or cancer diagnosed over 122 months, 123 (71.9\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 65.2\% to 78.7\%) had baseline Pap results of atypical squamous cells or worse and/or a positive HPV test, including 102 (86.4\%, 95\% CI = 80.3\% to 92.6\%) of the 118 cases diagnosed within the first 45 months of follow-up. During this 45-month period, the cumulative incidence of CIN3 or cancer was 4.54\% (95\% CI = 3.61\% to 5.46\%) among women with a Pap test result of atypical squamous cells or worse, positive HPV tests, or both compared with 0.16\% (95\% CI = 0.08\% to 0.24\%) among women with negative Pap and HPV tests. Age, screening behavior, a history of cervical cancer precursors, and a history of treatment for CIN minimally affected results. CONCLUSIONS: Negative baseline Pap and HPV tests were associated with a low risk for CIN3 or cancer in the subsequent 45 months, largely because a negative HPV test was associated with a decreased risk of cervical neoplasia. Negative combined test results should provide added reassurance for lengthening the screening interval among low-risk women, whereas positive results identify a relatively small subgroup that requires more frequent surveillance.}

We designed a cross-sectional descriptive study set at an urban public hospital medical clinic. All women 65 years of age and older were eligible to be screened. We measured these main outcomes: rates of participation, abnormal tests, and neoplasia. Women were offered screening during a routine visit. Of 689 women, 491 (71\%) participated. Mammography was completed by 66\% of women; one had stage 1 cancer, and 76\% were negative. Among the women (24\%) with abnormal mammograms, the overwhelming majority were diagnosed with benign lesions. For ten of 450 women completing Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, results were suspicious or positive for malignancy, for a prevalence rate of 22.2/1,000 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 8.6/1,000 to 35.8/1,000). Three were subsequently designated falsely positive; five had confirmed cervical neoplasia; and two had other reproductive malignancies. Two women with negative smears also had neoplasia: one with vulvar cancer and one with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia, for a total of six cervical neoplasias. Interestingly, one-fifth of women with a hysterectomy had an intact cervix, including one with cervical neoplasia. Nearly one-third of women with abnormal Paps or mammograms failed to complete follow-up. Success of screening programs for the elderly will depend on the risk group targeted, careful examination, degree of sensitivity and specificity of the tests, and acceptability of follow-up diagnosis and treatment.}

This assumption seems questionable in many organs, including the liver. In this paper, it is relaxed and arbitrary shapes are allowed for the clones. The proposed method is illustrated by reanalysis of the data considered in the earlier paper. The new analysis yields parameter estimates that are more plausible biologically than those of the original analysis.}

One thousand five hundred and thirty-seven provided saliva for cotinine analysis. Of 808 who claimed not to be users of such products, 2.5\% had cotinine values above 30 ng/ml, suggesting their self reports were false. In another study 540 subjects were interviewed in 1980 and in 1985. Ten per cent claiming on one occasion never to have smoked, made inconsistent statements on the other occasion. A third study showed a strong tendency for smokers to marry smokers. 5 Estimates of bias based on these data indicate that misclassification can explain the unexpectedly high lung cancer risk associated with spouse smoking in epidemiological studies of self-reported never smokers.},

These were subdivided into trials of antivirals, trials for drugs used in opportunistic infections or symptomatic HIV and epidemiological studies. The setting was an established London teaching hospital. All patients diagnosed HIV-positive and attending between July 1983 and 1 January 1999 with one measured CD4 count and at least one follow-up visit were included. METHODS: The demographics of those participating in a clinical study were compared to those not enrolling using chi2 tests and Wilcoxon tests. Cox models were used to determine factors related to participation in clinical studies. RESULTS: Data from 2703 patients representing 5342.7 person-years' follow-up were assessed. Median time of follow-up was 23.6 months. Six hundred and eighty-seven (33\%) patients had ever participated in a clinical study. After adjustment for demographic factors in multivariate analysis using Cox models, homosexuals were more likely to participate compared with heterosexuals or injecting drug users (IDU) (P = 0.0035 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Women were more likely to enter a study (P = 0.02) and there was no difference between Caucasians and black Africans (P = 0.35). Between the three types of studies few differences were seen. CONCLUSION: High rates of participation in clinical trials and epidemiological studies were seen in this cohort. In keeping with other studies, homosexual men were well represented but IDU were under-represented. However, women and black African patients showed good uptake of all clinical studies. Hence in this population there is some success in targeting representative groups to participate in clinical studies, but more effort needs to be made with IDU},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 852 consecutive individuals diagnosed with AIDS at Fairfield Hospital between 1984 and 1994. Demographic data, year of diagnosis, CD4 cell counts, treatment for KS and PCP prophylaxis were included in the analysis. Survival following a diagnosis of KS was evaluated, adjusting for the effects of year of diagnosis, primary or secondary KS and degree of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: The overall cumulative incidence of KS by three years post ADI was 34\%. Median survival for KS as an ADI (n = 130) was 20 months versus 9 months for KS subsequent to another ADI (n = 75, P {\textless} 0.001). Those with KS as an ADI had a higher CD4 count (median 90 vs. 11, P {\textless} 0.001), lower incidence of visceral disease (5 of 130 vs. 11 of 75, P = 0.032) and fewer associated AIDS related illnesses (1 vs. 2, P {\textless} 0.001). Poorer survival following diagnosis of KS was associated with a lower CD4 count at diagnosis of KS (P = 0.002), extensive cutaneous or visceral KS at diagnosis (P = 0.009 and P {\textless} 0.001 respectively) and with the number of associated AIDS related illnesses (P {\textless} 0.001). A multivariate analysis suggested that, after adjusting for these factors, there was no difference in survival between primary and secondary KS. CONCLUSION: We found no difference in survival between primary and secondary KS after adjusting for potential confounding factors. We cannot exclude, however, that the greater incidence of visceral disease identified in secondary KS reflects an inherently more aggressive biology},

Quantitatively, however, the association has been variable and it is clear that due to differing cultural, social and individual determinants of suicide, the relationship is complex. Methodological difficulties abound with interpretation of aggregate data. Australian records for most of the present century are suitable for examining secular trends in suicide and unemployment by age group and gender to gain an indication of the extent to which both parameters may be causally related. An aggregate/ecological study was designed to incorporate quantitative and qualitative strategies. Annual age-adjusted male and female suicide rates and annual unemployment rates were derived for the period 1907-1990. Female suicide rates were generally stable throughout the period, whereas those for males demonstrated sharp fluctuations with the peaks coinciding with times of high unemployment. The association between suicide and unemployment for 15-24 year old males was comparatively high for the recent period, 1966-1990. The increasingly youthful contribution to male suicide was demonstrated by a rise in the loss of life years during 1973-1984. Despite the inability of any investigation based on aggregate data to establish an unequivocable causal relationship, no evidence was detected to suggest that relatively high population levels of unemployment were not related to the occurrence of suicide.}

The inverse association was more notable for cases with advanced disease and for cases diagnosed 5-15 years after phlebotomy.

Other factors at baseline, including CD4 cell count, viral load, previous AIDS, previous antiretroviral drug use and make-up of the NNRTI-containing regimen were all approximately similar between the nevirapine and efavirenz groups. A total of 669 patients experienced virological failure during follow-up. In a Cox model, less protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) previously used, higher CD4 nadir, lower viral load at baseline, a previous AIDS diagnosis and less NRTIs in the regimen were associated with lower risk of virological failure. The relative hazard of virological failure comparing those on efavirenz with those on nevirapine was 0.57 (95\% confidence interval, 0.47-0.69; P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in virologic outcome between those using nevirapine and efavirenz in this almost entirely drug-experienced population could reflect differences in effectiveness of the drugs in this setting but, despite the similarity between groups at baseline, bias cannot be excluded as an explanation. Replication of these findings in randomized trials and other cohort studies is required},

The base-line Karnofsky performance score and weight increased significantly among AZT recipients (P less than 0.001). A statistically significant increase in the number of CD4 cells was noted in subjects receiving AZT (P less than 0.001). After 12 weeks, the number of CD4 cells declined to pretreatment values among AZT recipients with AIDS but not amonG AZT recipients with AIDS-related complex. Skin-test anergy was partially reversed in 29 percent of subjects receiving AZT, as compared with 9 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001).

Although average remaining life expectancy in the affected age groups is usually several decades, data regarding survival perspectives beyond 10 to 20 years after diagnosis are sparse. The aim of this study was to assess long-term survival in a large population-based sample of patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relative survival within up to 40 years after diagnosis was assessed for cohorts of women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years and notified to the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry within various time intervals since 1953. In addition, up-to-date estimates of 40-year relative survival were obtained by exclusively looking at the survival experience of breast cancer patients in recent years (1993 to 1999) using period analysis, a new method of survival analysis. RESULTS: Prognosis of patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years has considerably improved during the past decades. According to the latest estimates from period analysis, cumulative 40-year relative survival is now approximately 43\% for all cancers combined, 57\% for localized cancers, and 24\% for cancers with regional tumor spread. Nevertheless, patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years continue to have increased mortality throughout at least four decades after diagnosis. This applies even if breast cancer is diagnosed in a localized stage and in the absence of a second primary breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Despite major improvement in prognosis over time, breast cancer occurring among patients who are younger than 50 years remains a chronic disease that affects prognosis for decades.}

Further, this direct quantitative comparison of antibodies to HIV virus protein bands can be used as a prognostic marker for disease states.}

We make the causal structure of Simpson's example explicit.


RESULTS

We show how the paradox disappears when the statistical analysis is appropriately guided by subject-matter knowledge. We also review previous explanations of Simpson's paradox that attributed it to two distinct phenomena: confounding and non-collapsibility.


CONCLUSION

Analytical errors may occur when the problem is stripped of its causal context and analyzed merely in statistical terms.},

DESIGN: A notional cohort of 1140 seroconverters and a cohort study of 1270 HIV-infected individuals seroconverted between 1985 and 1994, and followed up to December 1995 (the Italian Seroconversion Study cohort). METHODS: Failure times and rate of the patients attending the clinic over the study period were simulated for the notional cohort. Three separate scenarios with different probabilities of making a visit were considered. Standard survival analysis techniques were used to assess the effect of the year of seroconversion on HIV progression. The progression to a CD4 cell count of 200 x 10(6)/l according to the calendar year of seroconversion in the Italian Seroconversion Study was assessed using different censoring strategies. RESULTS: A spurious effect of the year of seroconversion consistently appeared in 100 repeated simulations. When ignoring the visits occurring after the first year of follow-up in the Italian Seroconversion Study cohort, results supported the hypothesis of no effect of the year from seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of the censoring strategy is crucial when assessing the effect of year of seroconversion using survival analysis in cohort studies with intermittent visit structure. Different censoring strategies should be considered before firmly concluding that more virulent strains or the use of treatment are modifying the natural history of HIV disease from cohort studies of this nature},

Modification was defined as stopping or switching any antiretrovirals in the regimen, whereas discontinuation was defined as the simultaneous stopping of all antiretrovirals included in the initial regimen. Reasons were classified as immunological/virological failure (IVF) and toxicities and patient choice/poor compliance (TPC). RESULTS: The median CD4 count at starting HAART was 171 x 10(6) cells/l and viral load 5.07 log copies/ml. During a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 247 patients (44.4\%) modified their HAART regimen, 72 due to IVF (29.1\%) and 159 due to TPC (64.4\%) and a total of 148 patients (26.6\%) discontinued HAART. Older patients were less likely to modify HAART [relative hazard (RH), 0.73 per 10 years; P = 0.0008], as were previously treatment-naive patients (RH, 0.65; P = 0.0050), those in a clinical trial (RH, 0.64; P = 0.027) and those who started nelfinavir (RH, 0.57; P = 0.035).

	annote = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The pace of novel medical treatments and approaches to therapy has accelerated in recent years. Unfortunately, many potential therapeutic advances do not fulfil their promise when subjected to randomized controlled trials. It is therefore highly desirable to speed up the process of evaluating new treatment options, particularly in phase II and phase III trials. To help realize such an aim, in 2003, Royston and colleagues proposed a class of multi-arm, two-stage trial designs intended to eliminate poorly performing contenders at a first stage (point in time). Only treatments showing a predefined degree of advantage against a control treatment were allowed through to a second stage. Arms that survived the first-stage comparison on an intermediate outcome measure entered a second stage of patient accrual, culminating in comparisons against control on the definitive outcome measure. The intermediate outcome is typically on the causal pathway to the definitive outcome (i.e. the features that cause an intermediate event also tend to cause a definitive event), an example in cancer being progression-free and overall survival. Although the 2003 paper alluded to multi-arm trials, most of the essential design features concerned only two-arm trials. Here, we extend the two-arm designs to allow an arbitrary number of stages, thereby increasing flexibility by building in several `looks' at the accumulating data. Such trials can terminate at any of the intermediate stages or the final stage. METHODS: We describe the trial design and the mathematics required to obtain the timing of the `looks' and the overall significance level and power of the design. We support our results by extensive simulation studies. As an example, we discuss the design of the STAMPEDE trial in prostate cancer. RESULTS: The mathematical results on significance level and power are confirmed by the computer simulations. Our approach compares favourably with methodology based on beta spending functions and on monitoring only a primary outcome measure for lack of benefit of the new treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The new designs are practical and are supported by theory. They hold considerable promise for speeding up the evaluation of new treatments in phase II and III trials.},

DESIGN: States and Territory Health Departments notified new diagnoses of AIDS to the National AIDS Registry. Information on vital status and date of last medical contact was sought annually. METHODS: Survival was calculated for all adult and adolescent AIDS cases (n = 3204) in Australia diagnosed until 1 November 1991 and reported to the National AIDS Registry by 31 March 1994. The Cox regression method was used to identify independent predictors for survival. RESULTS: Age {\textless} 50 years, a CD4+ cell count {\textgreater} or = 100 x 10(6)/l and an initial diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma were independently associated with longer survival (P {\textless} 0.05). Acquisition of HIV through blood transfusion and the AIDS- defining illness non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were significantly associated with shorter survival. Survival improved substantially from 1986 to 1987, but did not improve further thereafter. A further study of initial AIDS-defining illnesses in a subgroup of individuals, i.e., men aged {\textless} 50 years at diagnosis who acquired HIV infection through homosexual or bisexual contact and diagnosed after 1987, showed that Kaposi's sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, oesophageal candidiasis and herpes simplex virus as initial AIDS-defining illnesses had a relatively better prognosis than other single illnesses. Furthermore, patients with multiple illnesses did not have a worse prognosis than patients with a single illness, provided all illnesses were those with a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initial AIDS-defining illness, as well as age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, HIV exposure and CD4+ cell count at diagnosis, plays an important role in survival following AIDS in Australia},

STUDY DESIGN: A 2-year follow-up of 897 cases of LSIL and 1193 cases of HPV DNA positive ASCUS from the ASCUS/LSIL Triage Study was used to simulate American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Conference recommendations. Women with CIN grade 1 or less were followed up for 2 years by semiannual cytologic examination, with universal exit colposcopy. The clinical end point was a cumulative clinical center histologic diagnosis of CIN grade 2 or 3. RESULTS: The cumulative risk of CIN grade 2 or 3 was equivalent for LSIL (27.6\%) and HPV positive ASCUS (26.7\%). After excluding the women with a diagnosis of CIN grade 2 or 3 at initial colposcopy and directed biopsy (17.9\%), the remaining women were at nearly identical risk for subsequent CIN grade 2 or 3 regardless of initial colposcopy result (completely negative colposcopy-11.3\%; negative colposcopically directed biopsy-11.7\%; and CIN grade 1 biopsy-13.0\%). CONCLUSION: LSIL and HPV positive ASCUS are clinically equivalent. Initial colposcopic detection of obviously prevalent CIN grade 2 or 3 reduces risk. However, for the remaining women who have CIN grade 1 or less on colposcopy and directed biopsy, the risk for subsequent CIN grade 2 or 3 (whether missed, prevalent, or truly incident) is approximately 12\% over 2 years. This risk does not vary meaningfully by initial distinction of histologic CIN grade 1 from negative colposcopy and biopsy.}

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we examined community treatment patterns for advanced NSCLC, focusing on chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic (TNM system stages IIIb and IV) NSCLC diagnosed between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1999, were stratified based on chemotherapy agents received during the first 3 months following diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare survival, controlling for age, sex, race, noncancer comorbidity, stage at diagnosis, SEER region, and receipt of cancer-related surgery or radiation therapy in the first 3 months following diagnosis. Lifetime medical costs were calculated for each group. RESULTS: 14,875 patients met inclusion criteria: 7,411 (49.8\%) stage III and 7,464 (50.2\%) stage IV at diagnosis. Thirty-one percent received chemotherapy, 8\% received surgery, and 53\% received radiation therapy either as initial or adjuvant treatment. Persons {\textgreater} or = 75 years of age, females, African Americans, and those with more than one comorbidity were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy (P {\textless} .01). Survival was inferior for those who did not receive a platinum-containing agent (P {\textless} .01). Lifetime costs were highest for those receiving platinum + taxane combinations, exceeding other regimens by more than \$10,000 USD per patient. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy prolongs survival in community settings, but is underutilized for persons with advanced NSCLC. Reasons for lower use in minorities and variation across regions deserve further study.}

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) given at a dose of 500 mg/kg/wk has been shown to decrease the risk of acute GVHD, interstitial pneumonia, and infection in adults early after allogeneic transplantation. The current study is a controlled trial to determine whether a lower total dose of IVIg given with pretransplant loading reduces the incidence of transplant-related complications. In a randomized trial of 241 patients {\textgreater} or =20 years of age who were given related donor marrow allografts, 121 individuals receiving Ig prophylaxis (500 mg/kg/d loading from day -6 to -1 and then 100 mg/kg every 3 days from day 3 to 90) were compared with 120 control patients who did not receive IVIg. Randomization was stratified by human leucocyte antigen-matching, remission status of malignancy, GVHD prophylaxis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology. The study was powered to detect a reduction in acute GVHD by 18\% and a decrease in transplant-related mortality by 17\%. Pretransplant IVIg loading and posttransplant maintenance achieved median serum IgG levels {\textgreater}1350 mg/dL, which were approximately twofold greater than the untreated controls (p{\textless}0.01). White blood cell and platelet recoveries were similar for the two groups, although control patients required fewer units of platelets per day (2.5 vs. 3.3, p = 0.008). No significant differences in the incidence of CMV infection, interstitial pneumonia, or bacteremia were observed. The incidence of acute GVHD did not differ between the two groups; however, acute GVHD was less frequent among IVIg recipients achieving maximum serum IgG levels {\textgreater}3000 mg/dL (60 vs. 79\%). Neither transplant-related mortality nor disease-free survival was significantly altered by Ig prophylaxis. However, the cumulative incidence of relapse of malignancy was higher in IVIg recipients than in controls (31 vs. 18\%, p = 0.03). Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated a 1.89 increased relative risk of relapse for individuals given IVIg (p = 0.021). We conclude that pretransplant loading and a shorter course and lower total dose of IVIg prophylaxis did not appear to decrease the risk of acute GVHD or mortality among adults receiving related donor marrow transplants. Note, IVIg administration may be associated with an increased risk of recurrent malignancy, a finding that warrants further investigation.}

Assessing this method on simulated data, we find that it provides conservative 95 per cent bounds for the number of undiagnosed cases and future case numbers, and that these bounds are robust to modifications in the assumptions generating the simulated data. Moreover, the method provides a good estimate of the initial reproduction number, and the reproduction number in the latter stages of the outbreak. Applying the approach to SARS data from Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada, the bounds on future diagnosed cases are found to be reliable, and the bounds on hidden cases suggests that there were few hidden cases remaining at the end of the outbreaks in each region. We estimate that the initial reproduction numbers lay between 1.5 and 3, and the reproduction numbers in the later stages of the outbreak lay between 0.36 and 0.6.}

In this article, we use information on the increase and subsequent decline in prostate cancer incidence following the adoption of PSA to estimate the lead time associated with PSA screening. The lead time is a key determinant of the likelihood of overdiagnosis, one of the main costs associated with the PSA test. Our approach conceptualizes observed incidence as the sum of the secular trend in incidence, which reflects incidence in the absence of PSA, and the excess incidence over and above the secular trend, which is a function of population screening patterns and the unknown lead time. We develop a likelihood model for the excess incidence given the secular trend and use it to estimate the mean lead time under specified distributional assumptions. We also develop a likelihood model for observed incidence and use it to simultaneously estimate the mean lead time together with a smooth secular trend. Variances and confidence intervals are estimated via a parametric bootstrap. Our results indicate an average lead time of approximately 4.59 years (95\% confidence interval [3.24, 5.93]) for whites and 6.78 years [5.42, 8.20] for blacks with a corresponding secular trend estimate that is fairly flat after the introduction of PSA screening. These estimates correspond to overdiagnosis frequencies of approximately 22.7\% and 34.4\% for screen-detected whites and blacks, respectively. Our results provide the first glimpse of a plausible secular trend in prostate cancer incidence and suggest that, in the absence of PSA screening, disease incidence would not have continued its historic increase, rather it would have leveled off in accordance with changes in prostate patterns of care unrelated to PSA.}

The study reported a high sensitivity (96.3\%) for HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III. The authors concluded that HPV testing is a viable option for managing ASCUS smears. We have reviewed the published data from the ALTS trial and have found a large excess of colposcopies and biopsies in the HPV arm in comparison with the conservative management (cytology) arm. In addition, the ALTS trial quality control and pathology review results raise doubts about the diagnostic validity of the study to establish standards of clinical practice. Furthermore, until the 2-year follow-up analysis of the conservative management arm is completed to detect CIN III, a valid comparison between HPV triage and conservative management is not possible. We conclude that, based on published data, HPV testing for routine clinical management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities (ASCUS smears) is not warranted, and that HPV testing is currently an investigational tool.}

A new approach is proposed that combines the results of several imperfect reference tests to define a better reference standard. We call this the composite reference standard (CRS). Using the CRS, accuracy can be assessed using multi-stage sampling designs. Maximum likelihood estimates of accuracy and expressions for the variance of sensitivity and specificity are provided. Data from clinical literature on the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis are used to illustrate and compare the different approaches. Advantages of the CRS relative to other approaches include that the CRS is explicitly defined, does not depend on the results of the new test under investigation, and is easy to interpret.},

Increased usage of antivirals would have a beneficial epidemic-level effect (due to the decreased transmission of drug- sensitive strains) as well as potentially a detrimental epidemic-level effect (if drug-resistant strains emerge and are transmitted). Previously, we have developed a mathematical model that we have used to predict (with a degree of uncertainty) the beneficial and the potential detrimental epidemic-level effects of increased antiviral usage. Here, we use our model to make further predictions about the impact of increasing antiviral usage. We calculate the effect, on individual patients, of antiviral usage in terms of: (1) the decrease in the average number of infectious days per year and (2) an individual's lifetime probability of acquiring permanent drug resistance. We also use our model: (1) to determine the probability of eliminating herpes by antivirals and (2) to quantify the effect of increasing antiviral usage on decreasing HSV-2 prevalence. Our results show that theoretically it would be possible to eliminate herpes epidemics by using a drug that does not cure},

	annote = {The health effects of inhaled fibers are related to the intensity and duration of exposure and occur many years after the exposure. In particular, the incidence of mesothelioma after exposure to asbestos is proportional to the intensity of exposure (fibers per milliliter of air) and the duration of exposure, and to the time that has elapsed since the exposure. The incidence increases with time since exposure to a power of between 3 and 4. The disease process resulting from exposure to fibers in the air is presumably related to the dose of fibers in the lungs, which depends on the exposure level and duration, and also on the size characteristics of the fibers influencing their inhalation and retention in the lungs. Models incorporating these characteristics have been found to be satisfactory in explaining the incidence of mesothelioma over time after exposure to asbestos. Most of the epidemiological modeling has been for occupational exposure to one of the amphibole asbestos types (crocidolite or amosite), for which heavy exposure produces a high incidence of mesothelioma. Occupational exposure to chrysotile asbestos has resulted in a much lower incidence of mesothelioma. Crocidolite asbestos is much more biopersistent than chrysotile asbestos in the sense that after retention in the lungs it is eliminated only slowly (half-time of several years). If fibers are eliminated then the dose in the lungs declines following exposure, and this may influence the disease process. This concept is more important for synthetic mineral fibers, such as glass wool, which are used as a substitute for asbestos. These fibers are much less biopersistent than asbestos, with half-times of weeks or even days. Biopersistence is related to the dissolution of fibers. This is a physical-chemical process that may be expected to proceed at about the same rate in rats and humans. The predicted effect of biopersistence of fibers has been explored using the basic mesothelioma incidence model generalized to include a term representing exponential elimination over time. The influence of solubility of fibers on the mesothelioma rate is 17 times higher in humans than in rats. This is because rats are aging and developing cancer at a much quicker rate than humans, and hence the influence of dissolution is less. Thus, the predicted mesothelioma incidence in humans is highly dependent on the rate of elimination across the range covering asbestos and the more durable synthetic fibers, but in rats a similar dependence occurs at a 17 times higher rate of elimination corresponding to the less durable synthetic fibers. The possible carcinogenic effects of fibers are often determined from animal experiments, but these results suggest that the extrapolation from rats to humans is highly dependent on the biopersistence of fibers, in the situation where the elimination is through dissolution of fibers at a rate independent of species and the speed of the cancer process is species dependent. This implies that relatively soluble fibers that do not produce disease in rat experiments are even less likely to produce disease in humans.}

The ultimate purpose of the tables is to provide a scientific basis for determining compensation for such victims, and their use would represent a marked departure from the current tort system for deciding compensation. The preparation of radioepidemiologic tables requires extensive mathematical modeling because matters such as sex, size of dose, age at exposure, type of cancer, and age at diagnosis must be taken into account. The limited data require many assumptions about the quantitative relationship between radiation dose and the age-specific incidence rate of cancer. After partitioning a population into reference sets based on age at exposure, size of dose, type of cancer, etc., an assigned share is computed for each reference set and then assigned to all of its members. The assigned share represents the fraction of the cancer cases in the reference set that are attributed to the radiation dose. Because the population can be partitioned in many ways, each individual's assigned share depends on the partition used and will change with different partitions. Options for modeling and limitations in epidemiologic data lead to considerable uncertainties in estimates of assigned shares that have been scientifically evaluated for the Working Group's tables. In contrast, the uncertainties associated with the current approach for determining the likelihood that a claimant's cancer was caused by radiation have not been appraised, but are likely to be even greater than those associated with the Working Group's tables. One issue is how to use such tables to compensate victims. Some among many possibilities are: to use them together with a compensation formula to determine the fraction of a standard award to be given; to use them as a starting value for the fraction, to be modified by an authority on the basis of additional information supplied by the claimant and defendant; and to use them as input to the present compensation system.}

METHODS: Data were extracted from published studies of the years 1976, 1977 and 1990-96. RESULTS: Between 1976-77 and 1990-96 there was a large reduction in the amount of crocidolite in the lungs of both mesotheliomas and controls. CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with the use of the different asbestos types in the UK, after taking into account the period of exposure and elimination of fibres from the lung in the time elapsed since exposure.}

Each subject who had died from lung cancer (92), mesothelioma (31), or stomach cancer (17) was matched with up to 20 control subjects of the same age who were not known to have died before the index subject. Relations of dose and time of exposure to crocidolite to risk of death were modelled by conditional logistic regression. For lung cancer, the best fitting multiplicative model was one which estimated a relative risk (RR) of 1.12 (95\% CI 1.04-1.20) per year of exposure and 1.01 (95\% CI 1.00-1.01) per fibre/ml. This was statistically indistinguishable from an additive model showing an increase in RR of 0.01045 (95\% CI 0.008-0.020) per f/ml year. For mesothelioma the best fitting model appeared to be one estimating a RR of 24.9 (95\% CI 3.51-1.77) per log year since first exposed and a RR of 10.5 (95\% CI 3.12-35.1) if exposed for longer than six months. This was not distinguishable statistically from a model that showed mortality increasing as the fourth power of time since first exposed less the fourth power of time since last exposed. The effect of intensity of exposure on the RR for mesothelioma was only slight. There was no consistent effect of any measure of exposure to crocidolite on death from stomach cancer.}

Since these adverse effects may be dose related, we investigated the effect of tamoxifen on several biomarkers when the drug was given at doses lower than those currently in use. METHODS: In two sequential experiments, 127 healthy hysterectomized women aged 35-70 years were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatment arms: placebo (n = 31) or tamoxifen at 20 mg/day (n = 30) (first experiment); or tamoxifen at 10 mg/day (n = 34) or tamoxifen at 10 mg/ alternate days (n = 32) (second experiment). Baseline and 2-month measurements of the following parameters were compared: 1) total cholesterol (primary end point) and other surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, e.g., low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a); 2) blood cell count; 3) fibrinogen; 4) antithrombin III; 5) osteocalcin; and, 6) in a subgroup of 103 women, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a possible surrogate marker for breast cancer. RESULTS: After adjustment for the baseline values, there were reductions in circulating levels of total cholesterol and IGF-I of the same magnitude in all three tamoxifen treatment arms. A similar pattern was observed for most of the other parameters. In the placebo arm, fibrinogen level, which showed a decrease, was the only parameter exhibiting change. CONCLUSIONS: Up to a 75\% reduction in the conventional dose of tamoxifen (i.e., 20 mg/day) does not affect the activity of the drug on a large number of biomarkers, most of which are surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. This study was hypothesis generating, and larger studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of tamoxifen at low doses.}

Epidemiologic factors, such as number of lifetime sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and other factors, also were studied. All 17 seroconverters in the cohort who developed AIDS within 3 years (rapid progressors = RPs) were compared with 42 men without AIDS for at least 6 years seroconversion (nonrapid progressors = non-RPs). Plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV-1 structural genes, beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin, and interferon-alpha were measured at four time points: (a) the last seronegative visit, (b) the first seropositive visit, (c) the visit closest to AIDS (or the corresponding visit for the non-RPs) and (d) 6 years after seroconversion (for non-RPs). Up to seroconversion, the RPs had a significantly higher number of lifetime sexual partners than non-RPs (503 versus 171, respectively). At the first seropositive visit, RPs had significantly higher concentrations of plasma HIV-1 RNA (p {\textless} 0.01) and prevalence of p24 antigenemia (p {\textless} 0.001) and significantly lower levels of antibodies to the HIV-1 gag proteins p17 and p24 (p {\textless} 0.01-0.001) compared with non-RPs. These differences increased during follow-up visits. Antibodies to p66 and gp120 were significantly different only at the visit closet to AIDS (p {\textless} 0.001), as were beta-2 microglobulin and interferon alpha. These findings suggest that early virologic-immunologic events after HIV-1 infection may determine the rate of progression to AIDS. Anti-gag immune response may prevent rapid progression of HIV-1 disease and should be considered for future vaccine studies.}

In 136 subjects whose median duration of exposure was 37 months, radiographic asbestosis appeared between 1 and 34 yr after initial exposure and then progressed continuously. Total exposure to asbestos and time from first exposure to the appearance of definite radiographic asbestosis were significant determinants of the rate of progression of profusion of radiographic abnormality. Asbestosis should be considered to be an active disease even 3 decades after exposure has ended.}

Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates from 15 and 13 countries between 1973-77 and 1988-92, respectively, were compared to provide leads for future analytic studies. Large increases in both incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer were seen for all countries. For incidence, increases were more pronounced in the United States, Canada, Australia, France and the Asian countries, while the increases in medium-risk countries were moderate. Increases in incidence ranged from 25\%-114\%, 24\%-55\% and 15\%-104\% in high-, medium- and low-risk countries, respectively. Mortality rates rose more rapidly in Asian countries than in high-risk countries. Substantial differences in incidence and mortality across countries were evident, with U.S. blacks having rates that were 50-60 times higher than the rates in Shanghai, China. Increasing incidence rates in the United States and Canada are likely to be due in part to the widespread use of transurethral resection of the prostate and prostate-specific antigen testing, while increases in the Asian countries are probably related to westernization in these low-risk populations. The large disparities in incidence between high- and low-risk countries may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Future studies are needed to examine gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in various countries concurrently to shed light on the etiology of prostate cancer and to help elucidate reasons for the large differences in risk between populations.}

Crude and age-standardised mortality rates and numbers of deaths were computed for 23 geographical areas. Of the estimated 5.2 million deaths from cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), 55\% (2.8 million) occurred in developing countries. The sex ratio is 1.33 (M:F), greater than that of incidence (1.13) due to the more favourable prognosis of cancer in women. Lung cancer is still the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide with over 900,000 deaths per year, followed by gastric cancer with over 600,000 deaths and colorectal and liver cancers accounting for at least 400,000 deaths each. In men, deaths from liver cancer exceed those due to colo-rectal cancer by 38\%. Over 300,000 deaths of women are attributed to breast cancer, which remains the leading cause of death from cancer in women, followed by cancers of the stomach and lung with 230,000 annual deaths each. In men, the risk of dying from cancer is highest in eastern Europe, with an age-standardised rate for all sites of 205 deaths per 100,000 population. Mortality rates in all other developed regions are around 180. The only developing area with an overall rate of the same magnitude as that in developed countries is southern Africa. All of eastern Asia, including China, has mortality rates above the world average, as do all developed countries. The region of highest risk among women is northern Europe (age-standardised rate = 125.4), followed by North America, southern Africa and tropical South America. Only south-central and western Asia (Indian subcontinent, central Asia and the middle-eastern countries) and Northern Africa are well below the world average of 90 deaths per 100,000 population annually. Our results indicate the potential impact of preventive practices. It is estimated that 20\% of all cancer deaths (1 million) could be prevented by eliminating tobacco smoking. Infectious agents account for a further 16\% of deaths.}

HIV-1 RNA and DNA were quantified every 6 months in PBMC in these 27 patients, 14 of whom accepted excision lymph node biopsy after month 18 for HIV-1-RNA and -DNA quantification in lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMC). RESULTS: The median decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA, PBMC HIV-1 RNA and DNA over the 18 months of follow-up were 3.6 log (P{\textless} 0.005), 1.1 log (P{\textless} 0.05), and 1.0 log (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. HIV-1 DNA was detected in 92.3\% of PBMC samples at baseline and at month 18. In LNMC, 100\% of samples were detectable for HIV-1 DNA. CONCLUSION: In this highly selected population of patients with excellent plasma virological response under HAART, HIV-1 DNA showed a progressive decrease but was still detectable in 92.3\% of samples at month 18, whereas all LNMC samples tested scored positive for HIV-1 DNA. The utility of proviral HIV-1-DNA monitoring was not clearly demonstrated in this 18-month follow-up of HAART-treated primary-infected patients. However, this finding could be reconsidered when using other therapeutic strategies such as structured treatment interruptions, reinforced treatment or additive immunotherapy.}

The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968-1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance.

Age-specific lung cancer incidence rates among non-smokers are identical in the two cohorts. Within the framework of the model, the main effect of cigarette smoke is on the promotion of partially altered cells on the pathway to cancer. Smoking-related promotion is somewhat higher among women, whereas smoking-related malignant conversion is somewhat lower. In both cohorts the relative risk for a given daily level of smoking is strongly modified by duration. Among smokers, the incidence in NHS relative to that in HPFS depends both on smoking intensity and duration. The age-adjusted risk is somewhat larger in NHS, but not significantly so. After smokers quit, the risk decreases over a period of many years and the temporal pattern of the decline is similar to that reported in other recent studies. Among ex-smokers, the incidence in NHS relative to that in HPFS depends both on previous levels of smoking and on time since quitting. The age-adjusted risk among ex-smokers is somewhat higher in NHS, possibly due to differences in the age-distribution between the two cohorts.},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Australia has maintained a total national malignant mesothelioma case register since 1980. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of mesothelioma in the last 20 years. Currently 450-600 cases are notified annually in a population of 20 million. While the history of the Wittenoom (Western Australia) crocidolite mine and its aftermath is well known, these cases comprise only 5\% of the total. This study describes the incidence of mesothelioma in Australia from 1945 to 2000. METHODS: Using register data, time trends in mesothelioma incidence were calculated. Analyses of incidence are reported by age, sex, anatomical site, and state of notification. Associations with occupational and environmental asbestos exposure histories are described. Lung fiber content measurements were made on a subset of cases. RESULTS: Australia has had 6,329 cases of mesothelioma from 1 January 1945 to 31 December 2000. (A further 620 cases were notified in the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 October 2001.) Annual incidence rates for Australia per million population {\textgreater} or = 20 years (1997) were: male, 59.8; female, 10.9; total, 35.4. Incidence rates have been continually increasing and are the highest reported national rates in the world. While Western Australia has the highest rate (1997 total rate, 52.8), most cases arise from the two most populous eastern states, New South Wales and Victoria. In 88\% (male 90\%, female 61\%) of cases, a history of asbestos exposure was obtained. Exposures occurred in a wide variety of occupational and environmental circumstances. In 80\% of cases with no history of exposure, TEM lung asbestos fiber counts {\textgreater} 200,000 fibers {\textgreater} 2 microm length per gm dry lung were obtained, suggesting unrecognized exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Australia's high incidence of mesothelioma is related to high past asbestos use, of all fiber types, in a wide variety of occupational and environmental settings. The number of cases in total is expected to be about 18,000 by 2020, with about 11,000 yet to appear.}

Unlike the conventional incidence-rate estimates reported by SEER, this method considers only the first primary cancer, and adjusts for population-based cancer prevalence, as well as for surgical procedures which remove an individual from risk of developing a given cancer. Thus, risk-adjusted incidence-rates more accurately reflect the average cancer risk for individuals in the cancer-free, at-risk population. The results of the analysis indicate that, in general, incidence-rate estimates are fairly similar between the conventional and risk-adjusted methods. However, this is not the case for certain cancer sites which may have: (i) a high number of subsequent primary cancers (e.g., melanomas-skin); (ii) a high cancer prevalence proportion (e.g., prostate cancer); (iii) a high number of subsequent primary cancers and prevalence proportion (e.g., female breast); or (iv) a high prevalence of removal of the organ in question (e.g., cervical and uterine cancers). For example, by applying the risk-adjusted incidence method for in situ and invasive cervical cancer, we found that in the period 1990-92 the age-adjusted incidence-rate estimate increased from 57.8 to 66.3 (15 percent) per 100,000 person-years; the greatest increase in the incidence-rate estimate occurred for women aged 65 to 69 years, from 40.1 to 63.2 (58 percent) per 100,000 person-years; and the lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer increased from 4.6 (1 in 22) to 5.5 (1 in 18) percent.}

Infectious HIV-1 could not be cultivated from any lymph node mononuclear cells taken on day 90, and HIV-1 RNA was at very low levels in lymph nodes after 1 year. In some cases, waning of the antibody response to HIV-1 was shown by Western blot after several months of undetectable plasma RNA.

This study addresses the question of whether testing women who have low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) of the uterine cervix for HPV DNA is useful as a triage strategy. METHODS: Four clinical centers in different areas of the United States participated in a randomized clinical trial of the use of HPV DNA testing in women with cytologic evidence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or LSIL. The study sample in this article consists only of women who had LSIL at enrollment. Within 6 months of an LSIL diagnosis (based on a Pap smear read by a community-based cytopathologist), women who were 18 years of age or older completed a standardized questionnaire and underwent a pelvic examination that included collection of cervical specimens for HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture II (HCII)(R) assay. RESULTS: Among the 642 women referred with LSIL who had analyzable test results, the mean chronologic age and age at first coitus were similar among the four clinical centers, despite the centers' ethnic and geographic diversity. Overall, HPV DNA was detected in cervical samples from 532 (82.9\%) of the 642 women (95\% confidence interval = 79.7\%-85.7\%). This high frequency of HPV positivity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in a subset of 210 paired specimens tested by HCII and PCR (81.4\% were positive by both methods). CONCLUSION: Because a very high percentage of women with an LSIL diagnosis from Pap smears are positive for HPV DNA by HCII testing, there is limited potential for this assay to direct decisions about the clinical management of women with LSIL. The role of HPV testing in the management of women with ASCUS is still under study.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Harms and benefits of cancer screening depend on age and comorbid conditions, but reliable estimates are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the harms and benefits of cancer screening by age and comorbid conditions to inform decisions about screening cessation.
DESIGN: Collaborative modeling with 7 cancer simulation models and common data on average and comorbid condition level-specific life expectancy.
SETTING: U.S. population.
PATIENTS: U.S. cohorts aged 66 to 90 years in 2010 with average health or 1 of 4 comorbid condition levels: none, mild, moderate, or severe.
INTERVENTION: Mammography, prostate-specific antigen testing, or fecal immunochemical testing.
MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime cancer deaths prevented and life-years gained (benefits); false-positive test results and overdiagnosed cancer cases (harms). For each comorbid condition level, the age at which harms and benefits of screening were similar to that for persons with average health having screening at age 74 years.
RESULTS: Screening 1000 women with average life expectancy at age 74 years for breast cancer resulted in 79 to 96 (range across models) false-positive results, 0.5 to 0.8 overdiagnosed cancer cases, and 0.7 to 0.9 prevented cancer deaths. Although absolute numbers of harms and benefits differed across cancer sites, the ages at which to cease screening were consistent across models and cancer sites. For persons with no, mild, moderate, and severe comorbid conditions, screening until ages 76, 74, 72, and 66 years, respectively, resulted in harms and benefits similar to average-health persons.
LIMITATION: Comorbid conditions influenced only life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Comorbid conditions are an important determinant of harms and benefits of screening. Estimates of screening benefits and harms by comorbid condition can inform discussions between providers and patients about personalizing screening cessation decisions.

The aim of this study was to examine the extent and gender distribution of unassisted tobacco reduction and cessation in a cohort of moderate and heavy smokers and to identify possible predictor variables associated with these changes in smoking behavior.Methods. This was a prospective population study of 3,791 moderate and heavy smokers, 15 g tobacco/day or more, who were enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1976-1978 and attended a reexamination 5 years later. Data on smoking behavior were collected at baseline and follow-up. Smoking reduction was defined as a decrease in mean daily tobacco consumption of 10 g or more. Using multivariate logistic regression, subjects who reported reduced smoking or who reported smoking cessation were compared with subjects who continued the habit unchanged.Results. After 5 years 13\% of the men and 9\% of the women had reduced their tobacco consumption, and 9 and 7\%, respectively, had quit altogether. Smoking reduction was strongly associated with high tobacco consumption (25+ g/day) at baseline and also with severely impaired lung function (FEV1 {\textless} 50\% predicted) and overweight (BMI {\textgreater} 25). Predictors of smoking cessation included impaired lung function and a tobacco consumption of 15-24 g/day. Additional determinants of smoking reduction and cessation such as inhalation habits and sociodemographic variables differed by gender.Conclusions. Several predictors of smoking reduction and cessation were identified, indicating that these subgroups of smokers differ substantially from continuing smokers. This should be taken into account when assessing potential health benefits from these changes in smoking behavior (C) 2001 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.},

METHODS: The methodology of the study was essentially identical in New Zealand and SWT. The subjects in both countries were randomly selected from all births in the study regions. The subjects were randomly allocated an age at which to be interviewed using the same questionnaire in the two study areas. Obstetric records were also examined. Eighteen hundred subjects were selected in New Zealand and 700 subjects in SWT. RESULTS: Younger and unmarried mothers were slightly more common in New Zealand than in SWT. The prevalence of maternal smoking, prone sleeping position and infants' sharing of beds with another person were all higher in New Zealand than SWT, thus increasing the risk of SIDS (maternal smoking in pregnancy: 31.0\% vs 23.8\% respectively, chi 2 = 11.6, p = 0.001; prone sleeping position: 32.9\% vs 25.9\%, chi 2 = 18.9, p {\textless} 0.001; bed sharing: 10.5\% vs 6.8\%, chi 2 = 6.0, p = 0.14). However, New Zealand infants were breast fed more frequently and for longer than infants in SWT, which would tend to reduce the risk of SIDS in the New Zealand population. In combination the differences in the prevalences of these four risk factors explain only 20\% of the excess risk of SIDS in New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS: The high SIDS mortality rate in New Zealand is not simply explained by a high prevalence of known and modifiable risk factors for SIDS.}

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 3488 women with a community-based ASCUS interpretation were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy, triage that was based on enrollment HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology at a colposcopy referral threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or conservative management based on repeat cytology at a referral threshold of HSIL. All arms included 2 years of semiannual follow-up and colposcopy at exit. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was offered to women with histologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 at any visit or persistent CIN grade 1 at exit. The study end point was 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3. RESULTS: The 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3 was 8\% to 9\% in all study arms. The immediate colposcopy strategy yielded 53.6\% sensitivity for cumulative cases of CIN grade 3 diagnosed over 2 years. The human papillomavirus (HPV) triage strategy referred 55.6\% of women and detected 72.3\% of cumulative cases of CIN grade 3. A conservative management strategy of repeat cytology at the HSIL threshold referred 12.3\% of women while detecting 54.6\% of cumulative CIN grade 3. To compare triage tests, we re-estimated the performance of HPV and cytology in successfully referring women with underlying CIN grade 3 (ie, ignoring the insensitivity we discovered in colposcopically directed biopsies). A single enrollment HPV test identified 92.4\% of the women diagnosed with CIN grade 3. Serial cytology, even at an ASCUS threshold, would have required two visits to achieve similar sensitivity (95.4\%) and would have referred 67.1\% to colposcopy. CONCLUSION: HPV triage is at least as sensitive as immediate colposcopy for detecting CIN grade 3 and refers about half as many women to colposcopy. Follow-up that used repeat cytology is sensitive at an ASCUS referral threshold but requires two follow-up visits and ultimately more colposcopic examinations than HPV triage.}

	abstract = {The accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of a new screening test can be compared with that of a standard test by applying both tests to a group of subjects in which disease status can be determined by a gold standard (GS) test. However, it is not always feasible to administer a GS test to all study subjects. For example, a study is planned to determine whether a new screening test for cervical cancer ("ThinPrep") is better than the standard test ("Pap"), and in this setting it is not feasible (or ethical) to determine disease status by biopsy in order to identify women with and without disease for participation in a study. When determination of disease status is not possible for all study subjects, the relative accuracy of two screening tests can still be estimated by using a paired screen-positive (PSP) design in which all subjects receive both screening tests, but only have the GS test if one of the screening tests is positive. Unfortunately in the cervical cancer example, the PSP design is also infeasible because it is not technically possible to administer both the ThinPrep and Pap at the same time. In this article, we describe a randomized paired screen-positive (RPSP) design in which subjects are randomized to receive one of the two screening tests initially, and only receive the other screening test and GS if the first screening test is positive. We derive maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals for the relative accuracy of the two screening tests, and assess the small sample behavior of these estimators using simulation studies. Sample size formulae are derived and applied to the cervical cancer screening trial example, and the efficiency of the RPSP design is compared with other designs.},

The methods are compared with respect to their impact on inferences regarding the study factor's effect, as measured by test size and power, bias, mean-squared error, and confidence interval coverage rates. In situations in which the best decision (of whether or not to adjust) is not always obvious, the change-in-estimate criterion tends to be superior, though significance testing methods can perform acceptably if their significance levels are set much higher than conventional levels (to values of 0.20 or more).}

The model allows for the interaction between age and calendar time. The application to the main risk groups in Italy, male IVDUs and homosexuals, showed that age and the susceptible population were important in estimating the epidemic among IVDUs; interaction between age and calendar time was found to be significant, showing that among young IVDUs the risk of infection decreased faster than among older IVDUs. Sensitivity of the estimates to the assumption of population and choice of the infection function is investigated.}

METHODS: For 620 patients in two randomized, double-blind trials of lamivudine (3TC) and zidovudine (ZDV) plasma HIV RNA and CD4 lymphocyte count changes were compared in patients randomized to 3TC plus ZDV and patients randomized to other treatment arms. The effect of therapy on the HIV RNA level and CD4 count was compared with the effect of therapy on clinical endpoints over the same time period. RESULTS: Median baseline values for all subjects were 42 420 copies/ml for HIV RNA and 277 x 10(6)/l for CD4 count. During the trial a significantly lower HIV RNA level and higher CD4 count was sustained in the ZDV/3TC group compared with the other group, with a difference in the median area under the curve from baseline per month of follow-up of 0.38 log10 copies/ml HIV RNA and 0.18 log2 x 10(6)/l CD4 cells (P {\textless} 0.001 in each case). For patients who were initially asymptomatic or in CDC stage B, the adjusted relative hazard (RH) of AIDS for a twofold lower CD4 count was 3.14 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.44-6.83] and for a 10-fold higher HIV RNA level was 3.22 (1.20-8.59). The RH progression to AIDS expected with ZDV/3TC compared with the control treatments, given the observed effects of treatment on CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels, is 0.52, whereas the observed value was 0.16 (0.03-0.74). After adjustment for HIV RNA and CD4 changes over time the observed RH of progression to AIDS for ZDV/3TC treatment compared with controls was increased to 0.36 and was no longer significant (95\% CI, 0.07-1.85). CONCLUSION: In this analysis of two trials, the effects of ZDV/3TC in reducing plasma HIV RNA and raising peripheral blood CD4 counts were associated with concurrent clinical benefits and the effect of treatment on these markers could account for at least part of the clinical benefits of therapy that were observed},

This report presents the results of an investigation into mechanisms underlying the temporal trends in the incidence of these two forms of cancer in Scotland over the 20-year period, 1960-1979. The purpose of the study was to establish the independent effects of age, calendar time, and birth cohort on the observed pattern of incidence by adopting an alternative approach to this classical problem which can be employed when data are available as individual records. The most economic model found to explain the data involved the independent effects of site, sex, and age and different cohort effects in each sex. The cohort effect was more pronounced in men than women in older cohorts but, conversely, stronger in women than in men in younger cohorts, i.e., among those born most recently. This observation accords with the observed increase in the use of cigarettes in young women relative to young men. There appeared to be a small effect of calendar time which was the same in both sexes and both sites, although this main effect, it must be emphasized, could be eliminated from the model on statistical grounds. The effect can be interpreted to indicate the increase in the coverage of cancer registration in Scotland which has taken place since 1960. These results indicate that lung cancer risk in Scottish males will continue to fall, with the risk in women lagging 20 years behind, although the levels in women will probably not reach those attained by men.}

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of BAEW on reducing children's unhealthy weight gain. METHODS: BAEW had a quasi-experimental, longitudinal design with anthropometric and demographic data collected on Colac children in four preschools and six primary schools at baseline (2003, n=1001, response rate: 58\%) and follow-up (2006, n=839, follow-up rate: 84\%). The comparison sample was a stratified random selection of preschools (n=4) and primary schools (n=12) from the rest of the Barwon South Western region of Victoria, with baseline assessment in 2003-2004 (n=1183, response rate: 44\%) and follow-up in 2006 (n=979, follow-up rate: 83\%). RESULTS: Colac children had significantly lower increases in body weight (mean: -0.92 kg, 95\% CI: -1.74 to -0.11), waist (-3.14 cm, -5.07 to -1.22), waist/height (-0.02, -0.03 to -0.004), and body mass index z-score (-0.11, -0.21 to -0.01) than comparison children, adjusted for baseline variable, age, height, gender, duration between measurements and clustering by school. In Colac, the anthropometric changes were not related to four indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), whereas in the comparison group 19/20 such analyses showed significantly greater gains in anthropometry in children from lower SES families. Changes in underweight and attempted weight loss were no different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Building community capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity appears to be a safe and effective way to reduce unhealthy weight gain in children without increasing health inequalities.}

Eligible and consenting participants were administered a risk-factor questionnaire and underwent a pelvic examination, collection of cervical specimens for liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and Cervicography (National Testing Laboratories, Fenton, Missouri, U.S.A.). Patients were randomized to one of three arms: (1) immediate referral for colposcopy at enrollment, (2) follow-up with cytology only, and (3) use of HPV DNA testing to triage to colposcopy. All women are followed every six months for two years with pelvic examinations, cytologic and masked HPV testing, and masked Cervicography. Digital cervical images and cytology and histology slides are externally reviewed to maximize patient safety. RESULTS: We enrolled and randomized 3,488 eligible women with ASCUS and 1,572 women with LSIL. CONCLUSION: The successful enrollment, randomization and high rates of follow-up are encouraging.

A proportional hazards regression method was applied to the relative survival rates to obtain geographical differences that were adjusted for age, gender, period of diagnosis, sub-site and stage. Age, gender, period and stage explained most of the variability between the areas (50-100\% excess risk of death with respect to Osaka) in the survival rates for stomach cancer patients. In Iowa and Varese, information on the sub-site fully explained the remaining variability. The large survival differences between the four areas were almost totally due to the different case mixes of the stomach cancer patients. The importance of stage indicates that diagnostic delay may be a major clinical factor affecting survival.}

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 50 patients from the Frankfurt HIV cohort who had received treatment with a minimum of six drugs, and for whom a sample for baseline viral phenotyping was available. METHODS: Viral drug susceptibility was measured retrospectively from stored samples using the Antivirogram, a recombinant virus assay based method. Virological response was defined as a viral load of {\textless} 400 copies/ml at week 24. For analysis of treatment response, drop-outs were dealt with in two ways, either as failures (DAF) or censored (DAC). Several logistical regression models were applied to identify predictors of response, including baseline virus load, number of new drugs and phenotypic sensitivity scores. RESULTS: At baseline, drug resistance was extensive: 96\% of patients had viruses resistant to at least one drug class and 32\% had viruses resistant to all three drug classes. In the DAF analysis, 39 patients experienced virological failure. In the DAC analysis, eight were censored and 31 patients experienced virological failure. In multivariate models that adjust for baseline viral load, the number of new drugs and total phenotypic sensitivity scores, the baseline viral load and phenotypic sensitivity score remained significantly associated with virological outcome, whereas in those adjusted for baseline viral load, the number of new drugs, NRTI phenotypic sensitivity score and PI phenotypic sensitivity score, only the latter remained significantly associated with virological outcome. Both the DAF and DAC analyses produced similar results. In all models used, virological failure was shown to be significantly associated with baseline viral load and phenotypic sensitivity score. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis based on a small number of patients, viral drug susceptibility at baseline was strongly associated with virological outcome at 24 weeks, independent of covariates such as baseline viral load and treatment history. Baseline viral load also maintained a significant, independent association with virological outcome in most models},

In addition the proportion of patient follow-up spent in hospital and the impact of changing treatment regimens among all patients with HIV aged {\textgreater} or = 14 years and with at least one CD4 T-cell count seen at the Royal Free Hospital, London was also described. RESULTS: A total of 1806 patients were investigated with median follow-up of 21.1 months. Among all patients, the proportion of follow-up time spent as an in-patient decreased from 3.9\% in 1988 to 1.3\% in 1997 (P = 0.0015; test for trend). Hospital admissions for any cause peaked during 1989 at 72.0 per 100 patient years of follow-up (PYFU) and was 28.5 per 100 PYFU during 1997 (P {\textless} 0.0001; test for trend). There was a statistically significant decline in the proportion of follow-up time spent as an in-patient among patients with CD4 T-cell counts of {\textless} 50 x 10(6)/l from {\textgreater} 30\% before 1990 to {\textless} 5\% during 1997 (P = 0.026; test for trend). Hospital admissions varied greatly according to treatment regimen; in 1996 and 1997 just 0.1\% of follow-up time of patients on triple antiretroviral treatment regimens was spent as a hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Admissions to hospital began falling before the introduction of combination therapy and declined strikingly during 1996 and 1997 following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. These results have important implications for future allocation of resources and for patient management},

The CI5 I-IX database brings together the results from all nine volumes, spanning a period of some 50 years. In addition, unpublished annual data, with more diagnostic detail, are made available for many cancer registries with 15 or more years of recent data. We describe the construction and composition of the CI5 databases, and provide examples of how they can be used to prepare tables and graphs comparing incidence rates between populations. This is the classical role of descriptive statistics: to allow formulation of hypotheses that might explain the observed differences (geographically, over time, in population subgroups) and that can be tested by further study. Such statistics are also essential components in the planning and evaluation of cancer control programmes.}

To provide etiological clues, we evaluated the relationships of four polymorphic markers in the SRD5A2 gene, specifically, A49T (a substitution of threonine for alanine at codon 49), V89L (a substitution of leucine for valine at codon 89), R227Q (a substitution of glutamine for arginine at codon 227), and a (TA)n dinucleotide repeat, with prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in China, a population with the lowest reported prostate cancer incidence rate in the world. Genotypes of these four markers were determined from genomic DNA of 191 incident cases of prostate cancer and 304 healthy controls using PCR-based assays, and serum androgen levels were measured in relation to these genotypes. All study subjects had the wild-type AA genotype of the A49T marker, and 99\% had the RR genotype of the R227Q marker. For the V89L marker, prevalences of the LL, VV, and VL genotypes among controls were 35\%, 21\%, and 45\%, respectively. Compared with men with the VV genotype, those with the LL genotype had a statistically nonsignificant 12\% reduced risk (odds ratio = 0.88, 95\% confidence interval, 0.53-1.47). In addition, men with the LL genotype had significantly higher serum levels of testosterone and significantly lower serum levels of 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol glucuronide than men with other genotypes. Men heterozygous for the (TA)0 allele of the (TA)n marker had a modest, statistically nonsignificant risk reduction (odds ratio = 0.67; 95\% confidence interval, 0.39-1.12) compared with men homozygous for the (TA)0 allele, along with significantly higher serum dihydrotestosterone levels. The observed V89L genotype prevalences and the association between V89L genotypes and serum androgen levels support the hypothesis that genotypes associated with lower levels of 5alpha-reductase activity are more common in low-risk populations. Although we found no statistically significant associations of these SRD5A2 polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk, a small effect of these markers cannot be ruled out because of the rarity of certain marker genotypes. Larger studies are needed to further clarify the role of these markers and to elucidate whether genetic diversity of the SRD5A2 gene, alone or in combination with other susceptibility genes, can help explain the large racial/ethnic differences in prostate cancer risk.}

Uncertainty remains over what fraction of CD4+ T cells are infected and whether there are latent reservoirs for the virus. We show here that during the asymptomatic phase of infection there is an extremely low total body load of latently infected resting CD4+ T cells with replication-competent integrated provirus ({\textless}10(7) cells). The most prevalent form of HIV-1 DNA in resting and activated CD4+ T cells is a full-length, linear, unintegrated form that is not replication competent. The infection progresses even though at any given time in the lymphoid tissues integrated HIV-1 DNA is present in only a minute fraction of the susceptible populations, including resting and activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages.}

OBJECTIVES: To describe the immunological, virological and clinical response to HAART and to examine the frequency of modification of the HAART regimen among patients from a single treatment centre. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier estimation and incidence rates were used to describe responses to HAART (a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside drug in addition to at least two nucleoside analogues) among 421 patients from the Royal Free Hospital in London. RESULTS: The median CD4 cell count at starting HAART was 186 x 10(6) cells/l [interquartile range (IQR) 76-310] and viral load was 5.13 log10 copies/ml (IQR 4.66-5.56). At 6 months after starting HAART, 51.1\% of patients were estimated to have experienced a 100 x 10(6) cells/l increase in CD4 cell count; the median time for viral load to fall below 400 copies/ml was 3.7 months (95\% confidence interval 3.2-4.4). At 6 months after the first viral load was {\textless} 400 copies/ml, 16.4\% of patients were estimated to have failed on the basis of a single viral load {\textgreater} 400 copies/ml and 12.4\% were estimated to have failed if the more stringent definition of two viral loads above the limit of detection was used. Compared with the pre-HAART era, the incidence of death among patients on HAART was one sixth of that level; new AIDS-defining illnesses was one seventh; and hospital admissions was one fifth. In total, 141 patients (33.5\%) stopped at least one of the antiretroviral agents included as part of their HAART regimen; the occurrence of side effects was the most common reason (n = 63; 44.7\%). CONCLUSION: A good response occurred to an initial HAART regimen. There was a high rate of virological relapse, which varied considerably according to the definition of failure used. Even so, the rates of clinical progression and hospital admissions observed to date were low. Further follow-up of these patients is required to determine their long-term immunological, virological and clinical outcome},

METHOD: The study has three sections. One is based on data from 21 population-based Cancer Registries of the Italian Network of Cancer Registries for the period 1998-2002, that involve about 15,000,000 Italians. The data of the AIRT database are gathered and classified according to IARC rules. The second section presents estimates for all cancers and for the major cancer sites for Italy in 2006, estimates are based on the MIAMOD method. The third part presents data on mortality trends in Italy and in the Italian regions for the major cancer sites from 1970 to 2002. RESULTS: AIRT pool incidence and mortality data for 36 cancer sites are shown. Data for each registry are also compared. There are age-specific and age-standardised rates, cumulative risks, time trends (1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002), and some quality indexes. Other AIRT data are also available at www.registri-tumori.it. Overall cancer incidence is increasing among males and females, while mortality is decreasing. On average, one men every three and one women every four have the probability of having a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime (0-74 years). Among men, prostate surpassed lung as the most frequent cancer site. Among women, breast cancer represents about one fourth of all cases, and we also confirm the increasing trend of lung cancer. In Italy more than 250,000 new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) are estimated to be diagnosed every year among subjects 0-84 years old. Age-adjusted mortality is decreasing among males and females. The mortality differences between northern and southern regions, quite wide during the 1970s, are decreasing, and rates are becoming homogenous. Mortality started to decrease more recently in the South. CONCLUSIONS: This publication presents a wide and qualified documentation on cancer in Italy; it uses both observed data from the Cancer Registries that involve about one fourth of the resident population, and estimates; the latter enable us to have reliable data for the whole country. Mortality trends up to 2002 show several relevant changes. This publication is a scientific tool we want to offer to all those who work in the prevention, surveillance, care, and treatment of cancer in Italy.}

METHOD: Patients were randomized in three groups to receive the following: Group 1-nelfinavir (750 mg tid), saquinavir soft- gel capsule (SGC) (800 mg tid), and stavudine (40 mg bid); Group II- ritonavir (400 mg bid), saquinavir-SGC (400 mg bid), and stavudine (40 mg bid); or Group III-delavirdine (400 mg tid), saquinavir-SGC (800 mg tid), and stavudine (40 mg bid). Viral loads, CD4 count, and safety were assessed over a 24-week period with an additional 6-month follow- up. RESULTS: 73 patients received randomized therapy; 14 of whom were SQV naive, with a median baseline viral load of 3.6 log(10) and a CD4 count of 370 cells/mm(3). By 6 months, the median decreases in plasma viral loads were 0.26, 0.71, and 0.29 log(10) copies/mL for groups I, II, and III, respectively. The median increases in CD4 counts, for groups I, II, and III, were 52, 40, and 69 cells/mm(3) at 6 months, respectively. Changes in viral load and CD4 counts at 6 months and 1 year were not significantly different between the treatment groups. More patients discontinued therapy in the ritonavir arm (35\%) for drug intolerance or toxicity compared to either the nelfinavir or delavirdine arms (15\% and 5\%, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, baseline viral load, younger age, and baseline saquinavir resistance were significantly associated with detectable viral load at 24 weeks. CONCLUSION: The use of antiretroviral agents that pharmacokinetically boost saquinavir levels has a modest benefit in saquinavir-experienced patients},

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of screening women with 3 or more prior normal tests compared with screening those with no prior tests. METHODS: We used a validated cost-effectiveness model in conjunction with data on the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia in women enrolled in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Women were grouped according to age at the final Program Pap test (aged {\textless} 30, 30-44, 45-59, and 60-65 years) and by screening history (0, 1, 2, and 3+ consecutive prior normal Program tests) to estimate cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year associated with annual, biennial, and triennial screening. RESULTS: For women aged 30-44 years with no prior tests, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from 20,533 US dollars for screening triennially (compared with no further screening) to 331,837 US dollars for screening annually (compared with biennially) per life-year saved. Among same-aged women with 3 or more prior normal Program tests, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the same measures ranged from 60,029 US dollars to 709,067 US dollars per life-year saved. Inclusion of the most conservative utility estimates resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in excess of 100,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved associated with annual screening of same-aged women with 3 or more prior normal tests compared with biennial screening. CONCLUSION: As the number of prior normal Pap tests increases, the costs per life-year saved increase substantially. Resources should be prioritized for screening those never or rarely screened women. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.}

The mortality-to-incidence ratio initially was 40\% and increased to 70\% in the period 1985-88. A log-linear model showed that the more recent generations experienced the slowest increase in incidence. Incidence and mortality rates in women remained stable and did not exceed 1 per 100,000. The 5-year survival probability from invasive larynx cancer was 47\%. Survival rates had shown no particular trend by year and age at diagnosis. The main finding was that 5-year survival from supraglottis cancer is 20\% poorer than survival from glottis cancer. Supraglottis is the prevalent larynx subsite in countries with high larynx, oropharynx and oesophagus incidence rates. This supports the hypothesis that supraglottis cancer is more strongly linked to a synergistic effect of smoking and alcohol than glottis cancer.}

DESIGN: Prospective study including 58 treatment-naive subjects who commenced indinavir or nelfinavir and two nucleosides during primary (PHI; n = 28) or chronic HIV-1 infection (CHI; n = 30). METHODS: Naive (CD45RA+ 62L+), memory (CD45RA-) and activated (CD38+ HLA-DR+) T cell subsets were quantified at 1-2 monthly time intervals using 4-colour flow cytometry. RESULTS: At 1 year, HIV-1 RNA declined in both cohorts to undetectable levels ({\textless} 50 copies/ml), while median CD4 lymphocyte count increased from 470 to 758 x 10(6) cells/l in PHI and from 204 to 310 x 10(6) cells/l in CHI, reaching {\textgreater} 500 x 10(6) cells/l in 93\% of PHI, but only in 37\% of CHI subjects (P {\textless} 0.001).

Early increases ({\textless} 3 months) of CD4 lymphocytes were larger in subjects with PHI, consisting of naive CD45RA+ CD62L+ as well as memory CD45RA- CD62L+ cells (P = 0.001). CD4 activation declined from 5 to 2\% in PHI and from 13 to 6\% in CHI (P = 0.001), while CD8 cell activation was reduced from 33 to 15\% in PHI and from 42 to 19\% in CHI (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Immune reconstitution was more complete, occurred earlier and comprised both naive and memory CD4 T lymphocytes in subjects who commenced antiretroviral therapy during primary HIV-1 infection.}

We aimed to compare the results from observational databases with those from randomized trials. METHODS: Three treatment comparisons from randomized trials [Delta, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175, Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) 007 and ACTC 320] were mimicked in cohorts: (i) zidovudine monotherapy versus combination regimens of two nucleoside analogues; (ii) zidovudine combined with either didanosine or zalcitabine; and (iii) a dual combination versus a triple regimen including a protease inhibitor. Data for over 10 000 patients from the French Hospital Database on HIV, the EuroSIDA study and the Swiss HIV cohort study were analysed for each of the comparisons. Progression to AIDS disease or death was analysed in Cox models, adjusting for baseline differences, and results compared with randomized trials. RESULTS: For comparison (i) the adjusted relative risk estimates from cohorts were between 0.61 and 0.84, favouring combinations over monotherapy, compared with 0.57 to 0.63 for trials. For comparison (ii) relative risk estimates from cohorts ranged from 0.81 to 1.01 compared with 0.77 to 0.92 for trials. For comparison (iii), two of the cohorts showed similar results to the ACTG 320 trial but one indicated a higher risk of progression on triple therapy [relative risk 1.20, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.441, in direct contrast to the trial result (relative risk 0.50, 95\% CI 0.33-0.76). CONCLUSION: Serious biases can be present when comparing outcomes from the use of antiretroviral regimens in observational studies. However, such bias is not inevitable and careful interpretation of the results from several observational studies considered together is likely to be informative, guiding the design of new trials},

STUDY DESIGN: Eight hundred fifty-six AutoCyte Preparation System from cervicovaginal samples were evaluated by AutoCyte-Screen. AutoCyte-Screen displayed 120 cell images and 6 low-power images for review by the cytotechnologist. The cytotechnologist classified the case as WNL, abnormal or unsatisfactory. AutoCyte-Screen then revealed its classification as either unsatisfactory, WNL, abnormal or undecided. These classifications were combined to form an interactive result that was compared to the diagnosis from previous manual review. RESULTS: Interactive results were as follows: 251 (29.3\%) abnormal, 581 (67.9\%) WNL and 24 (2.8\%) unsatisfactory. The abnormal interactive result contained 15 ASCUS/AGUS and 25 SILs; the WNL interactive result contained 5 ASCUS/AGUS and 2 SILs. No ASCUS/AGUS or SILs were in the unsatisfactory interactive category. The false negative proportion was 10.5\% for the interactive diagnostic method vs. 15.7\% for manual review for LSIL. CONCLUSION: The interactive use of AutoCyte-Screen can effectively select those cases which are most likely to contain an epithelial abnormality and could therefore be used as a triage system to select cases for manual review. A case with an interactive result of unsatisfactory and abnormal should receive full manual review, while those classified as WNL may require a less extensive review for quality assurance purposes. This resultant decrease in the manual screening load could increase laboratory efficiency.}

The conference was attended by 121 representatives from 29 national organizations interested in cervical cancer screening issues. For the first time, guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology, developed from evidence-based literature, were presented to delegates from the majority of organizations with interest in cervical cancer screening, voted on, and revised when necessary to achieve a majority two-thirds approval. This development of consensus-approved guidelines is likely to be considered one of the most important milestones to date in the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology. The timing of this Consensus Conference resulted from the convergence of many different factors, including new cytologic terminology developed at the Bethesda 2001 workshop and publication of the enrollment data from the National Cancer Institute's Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL) Triage Study, otherwise known as ALTS. Additionally, new preliminary longitudinal ALTS data provided much of the information on the natural history of abnormal Papanicolaou tests and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), as well as data on the performance of both new liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in the management of women following colposcopy. The result was a large database of new information that provided the foundation for the ASCCP Consensus Conference. This article covers only the recommendations of the ASCCP Guidelines that were based in large part on the results of the ALTS trial. Therefore, the focus is on the management of women with equivocal (ASC-US) and low-grade (LSIL) cytologic abnormalities. Management of women with these cytologic abnormalities has been particularly problematic, because individually these women are at least risk for CIN 3 and cancer, yet their sheer numerical dominance ensures that they account for the majority of high-grade CIN detected in the United States in the follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology. Data from ALTS confirmed that women with ASC-US could be safely managed by any of the conventional approaches (repeat Papanicolaou test, immediate colposcopy, or HPV testing), but that the preferred management approach for women having an ASC-US report from liquid-based cytology was to assess the patient's risk by testing for HPV. Additionally, longitudinal ALTS data determined that repeat liquid-based cytology at 6 and 12 months and an HPV test at 12 months were nearly equivalent options in the follow-up of women referred for HPV-positive ASC or LSIL, yet not found to have CIN 2+ at initial colposcopy. Therefore, all follow-up recommendations for women with CIN 1 or lower postcolposcopy findings include these 2 options. The data and the recommendations for the management of ASC-US, ASC cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and LSIL are discussed.}

The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of locoregional (LR) and distant recurrence and the survival and its determining factors after first recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included all women resident in Guipuzkoa who were diagnosed with invasive, non-disseminated breast cancer during 1995 and 1996 identified via Guipuzkoa's Cancer Registry. Recurrences that occurred up to December 2004 were determined retrospectively and compared with the National Death Registry of 2007 to determine the mortality. Relative survival was calculated by the Hakulinen method. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty one women with tumours in stages I-III were included, 90\% of whom were treated with conservative surgery+radiation therapy, or mastectomy. The median follow-up for recurrence was eight years, with 5,7\% of these recurrences being LR and 23\% distant metastases. The median follow-up after recurrence was 6,1 years for live patients and 1,04 years for dead ones. The three-year survival was 54\% (95\% CI: 0,31-0,78) after LR recurrence and 18\% (95\% CI: 0,09-0,28) after distant recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that the factors that remained as independent predictors of survival after LR recurrence were time to recurrence, age and degree of differentiation of the initial tumour. Age, time to recurrence and nodal involvement were associated with survival after distant recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Women younger than 54 at initial diagnosis with short disease-free periods and poorly differentiated tumours with nodal involvement have worse prognosis, which should be taken into account when deciding the therapeutic strategy to be followed upon recurrence.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether drug selection (PI versus NNRTI) in antiretroviral-naive patients is related to virological response at 6 months within a clinical cohort. DESIGN: Databases from two large clinics were used to identify all treatment-naive patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (PI/ two PI or NNRTI). Statistical models determined the likelihood of suppressing HIV viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml, the risk of treatment failure by 6 months, and factors associated with treatment success. RESULTS: Of 1109 potentially eligible patients 888 met study criteria and were included; 484 were prescribed a PI (40\% indinavir, 41\% nelfinavir) and 404 were prescribed NNRTI (40\% efavirenz, 60\% nevirapine). Three treatment arms were compared: efavirenz versus nevirapine versus PI. After stratification by year and centre and adjustment for baseline variables, only treatment group and baseline viral load remained significantly associated with virological suppression at 6 months. Patients on efavirenz were significantly more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load than those on PI or nevirapine. The relative hazard for nevirapine was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.96, P = 0.02) and that for PI was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.58-0.94, P = 0.01). Efavirenz also performed better in the analysis of treatment failure at 6 months.

METHODS: We used a database linking the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry with Medicare claims to extract treatment information for 90,128 men aged 65 years and older, who were newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. RESULTS: The use of aggressive therapy has increased among white men over time; but aggressive therapy has recently declined among African-American men. Accounting for age, grade, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity, African-American men were 26\% less likely to receive aggressive therapy than white men (odds ratio 0.74; 95\% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.79). The use of ADT has increased substantially in both the primary and the adjuvant settings. By 1999, 45.6\% of white men and 35.8\% of African-American men who selected conservative management received primary ADT; among men treated with external beam radiotherapy, the proportion receiving adjuvant ADT was 53.7\% for white men and 42.4\% for African-American men (P {\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in the use of aggressive and conservative therapies are increasing. ADT is becoming a widely adopted component of initial treatment for localized prostate cancer. It is crucial to understand the impact of treatment patterns, including the increased use of ADT, on patient survival, morbidity, and costs of care.}

The purpose of this report was to investigate temporal trends in long-term survival from breast cancer in all New South Wales (NSW) women. Breast cancer cases incident in 1972-1996 (54,228) were derived from the NSW Central Cancer Registry-a population-based registry which began in 1972. All cases of breast cancer not known to be dead were matched against death records. The expected survival for NSW women was derived from published annual life tables. Relative survival analysis compared the survival of cancer cases with the age, sex and period matched mortality of the total population. Cases were considered alive at the end of 1996, except when known to be dead. Proportional hazards regression was employed to model survival on age, period and degree of spread at diagnosis. Survival at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years of follow-up was 76 per cent, 65 per cent, 60 per cent, 57 per cent and 56 per cent. The annual hazard rate for excess mortality was 4.3 per cent in year 1, maximal at 6.5 per cent in year 3, declining to 4.7 per cent in year 5, 2.7 per cent in year 10, 1.4 per cent in year 15, 1.0 per cent for years 16-20, and 0.4 per cent for years 20-25 of follow-up. Relative survival was highest in 40-49 year-olds. Cases diagnosed most recently (1992-1996) had the highest survival, compared with cases diagnosed in previous periods. Five-year survival improved over time, especially from the late 1980s for women in the screening age group (50-69 years). Survival was highest for those with localised cancer at diagnosis: 88.4 per cent, 79.1 per cent, 74.6 per cent, 72.7 per cent and 72.8 per cent at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years follow-up (excluding those aged {\textgreater}or=70 years). There was no significant difference between the survival of the breast cancer cases and the general population at 20-25 years follow-up. Degree of spread was less predictive of survival 5-20 years after diagnosis, compared with 0-5 years after diagnosis, and was not significant at 20-25 years of follow-up. Relative survival from breast cancer in NSW women continues to decrease to 25 years after diagnosis, but there is little excess mortality after 15 years follow-up, especially for those with localised cancer at diagnosis, and the minimal excess mortality at 20-25 years of follow-up is not statistically significant.}

Standardised mortality and incidence rates were used to compare former workers with the Western Australian male population. Cases were matched with up to 10 randomly assigned controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between asbestos exposure, smoking status and cancer incidence. There were 129 incident cases from all cancers of interest and 57 deaths. Former workers had a significantly higher risk of mortality from upper aerodigestive cancers than the Western Australian male population. The incidence of upper and lower aerodigestive cancers was higher in the Wittenoom cohort but not significantly so. Cumulative exposure to asbestos did not appear to be associated with the incidence of stomach cancer, colorectal cancer or upper aerodigestive cancers. Smoking status was strongly associated with the incidence of upper aerodigestive cancers, with current smokers experiencing the greatest risk. Our study with longer and more complete follow-up, smoking information and a stronger study design does not show an association between cumulative asbestos exposure and stomach cancer or other gastrointestinal cancers. The excess mortality from upper aerodigestive cancers seen in this cohort of former asbestos workers compared to the Western Australian male population does not appear to be associated with exposure to crocidolite.}

Associations between job conditions and health persisted after adjustment for gender, education, marital status, employment status, major life events, and negative affectivity (personality). When adjusted for job strain, high job insecurity was independently associated with a greater than threefold increase in odds for poor SRH, depression and anxiety (OR (95\% confidence intervals) poor SRH: 3.72 (1.97 to 7.04) depression: 3.49 (1.90 to 6.41), anxiety: 3.29 (1.71 to 6.33)), and a twofold increase for physical health 2.19 (1.21 to 3.95).

These adverse job conditions are on the increase, particularly insecure employment, and the influence of these two work conditions are an important focus for future public health research and their prevalence and impact should be examined in other occupations.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

To provide quantitative insight into current U.S. policy choices for cervical cancer prevention, we developed a model of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, explicitly incorporating uncertainty about the natural history of disease.


METHODS

We developed a stochastic microsimulation of cervical cancer that distinguishes different HPV types by their incidence, clearance, persistence, and progression. Input parameter sets were sampled randomly from uniform distributions, and simulations undertaken with each set. Through systematic reviews and formal data synthesis, we established multiple epidemiologic targets for model calibration, including age-specific prevalence of HPV by type, age-specific prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), HPV type distribution within CIN and cancer, and age-specific cancer incidence. For each set of sampled input parameters, likelihood-based goodness-of-fit (GOF) scores were computed based on comparisons between model-predicted outcomes and calibration targets. Using 50 randomly resampled, good-fitting parameter sets, we assessed the external consistency and face validity of the model, comparing predicted screening outcomes to independent data. To illustrate the advantage of this approach in reflecting parameter uncertainty, we used the 50 sets to project the distribution of health outcomes in U.S. women under different cervical cancer prevention strategies.


RESULTS

Approximately 200 good-fitting parameter sets were identified from 1,000,000 simulated sets. Modeled screening outcomes were externally consistent with results from multiple independent data sources. Based on 50 good-fitting parameter sets, the expected reductions in lifetime risk of cancer with annual or biennial screening were 76\% (range across 50 sets: 69-82\%) and 69\% (60-77\%), respectively. The reduction from vaccination alone was 75\%, although it ranged from 60\% to 88\%, reflecting considerable parameter uncertainty about the natural history of type-specific HPV infection. The uncertainty surrounding the model-predicted reduction in cervical cancer incidence narrowed substantially when vaccination was combined with every-5-year screening, with a mean reduction of 89\% and range of 83\% to 95\%.


CONCLUSION

We demonstrate an approach to parameterization, calibration and performance evaluation for a U.S. cervical cancer microsimulation model intended to provide qualitative and quantitative inputs into decisions that must be taken before long-term data on vaccination outcomes become available. This approach allows for a rigorous and comprehensive description of policy-relevant uncertainty about health outcomes under alternative cancer prevention strategies. The model provides a tool that can accommodate new information, and can be modified as needed, to iteratively assess the expected benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different policies in the U.S.},

None of the 61 men whose tumor was found incidentally to a transurethral resection died as a result of this cancer, while it was the cause of death of 9 of 106 (8\%) men with clinical cancer localized to the prostate. Forty-six of the 107 (43\%) men with more extensive disease at the time of diagnosis died from prostate cancer. Step sectioning of the prostate identified prostate cancer in 80 of 293 (27\%) autopsied Hawaii Japanese men who died after 50 years of age, reaching a frequency of 63\% (10 of 16) among men over 80 years of age. The volume of 48 (60\%) of these cancers was less than 150 mm3. These small tumors would probably not have been discovered in a screening program. Tumors larger than 1000 mm3 would probably be discovered using modern diagnostic procedures but were found in only 13 (4.4\%) of the autopsied men. It is likely that a screening program to detect and treat such large, unsuspected tumors in this population would have had little impact upon the already low proportion of deaths due to prostate cancer among these Japanese men.}

The patients remained at low risk of developing AIDS until their CD4 lymphocyte count fell to 0.25 X 10(9)/l. From this point, the risk increased as their count approached zero. Using this result and on the assumption (which is evaluated) that the underlying trend over time in CD4 lymphocyte counts is linear, the predicted rate of progression to AIDS was calculated for the cohort. It was estimated that 73\% (95\% confidence limits 60-86\%) of the cohort will develop AIDS within 15 years of HIV-seropositivity. During 8 years of follow-up, this cohort had shown similar rates of progression to AIDS to other cohorts--haemophilic and otherwise--suggesting that this estimate may well have general applicability. The method described could be used to plan the provision of health-care resources for groups of anti-HIV-positive patients as it allows the number of new cases of AIDS to be predicted year by year, even when the patients' dates of seroconversion are unknown},

Bailout stenting was more frequently needed in women (28\% vs. 17.8\%; P = 0.001). No difference was observed in the number of stent implanted per vessel and per patient and average maximal inflation pressure used for stent postdilation. However, a smaller final balloon size was used in women. Procedural and clinical success was achieved in 94.4\% and 92.5\% of women and 96.7\% and 94.5\% of men (P = NS), respectively, without differences regarding in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. Bleeding complications occurred more often in women when anticoagulation was used (OR = 2.87; 95\% CI = 1.38-5.74). At 6-month clinical follow-up, TLR was similar between the sexes and event-free survival was 75.5\% in women and 81.5\% in men (P = NS). Angiographic follow-up, performed in 71\% of the patients, showed that restenosis was 64\% higher in women (OR = 1.64; 95\% CI = 1.02-2.61). Despite older age, higher incidence of comorbidities, and more unstable presentation, women treated with coronary stenting showed acute and mid-term clinical results similar to those observed in men. However, they were significantly more likely to develop angiographic restenosis.}

These relationships provide a simple basis for risk assessment, and support the suggestion that mesotheliomas may constitute a high proportion of cancer deaths resulting from early exposure to asbestos.}

METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of HIV-infected Africans and non-Africans attending 11 specialist HIV/AIDS units in London enrolled for a comparison of the natural history of HIV/AIDS in different ethnic groups. RESULTS: A total of 2048 patients were studied of whom 627 (31\%) developed 1306 different AIDS indicator diseases. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia accounted for 159 (25\%) of initial AIDS episodes and tuberculosis for 103 (16\%). In patients with HIV disease, tuberculosis had the lowest risk [relative risk (RR), 1.11; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.63], and high-grade lymphoma had the highest risk (RR, 20.56; 95\% CI, 2.70-156.54) for death. For patients with a prior AIDS-defining illness, the development of subsequent AIDS indicator diseases such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (RR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.77-1.83) and tuberculosis (RR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 0.76-2.47) had the best survival, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had the worst survival (RR, 9.67; 95\% CI, 1.26-74.33). Patients with tuberculosis had a lower incidence of subsequent AIDS-defining conditions than persons with other initial AIDS diagnoses (rate ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable variation exists in the relative risk of death following different AIDS-defining conditions. The development of any subsequent AIDS-defining condition is associated with an increased risk of death that differs between diseases, and this risk should be considered when evaluating the impact of specific conditions. Like other AIDS-defining conditions, incident tuberculosis was associated with adverse outcome compared with the absence of an AIDS-defining event, but we found no evidence of major acceleration of HIV disease attributable to tuberculosis},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that the harms of existing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies outweigh the benefits.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate comparative effectiveness of alternative PSA screening strategies.
DESIGN: Microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality quantifying harms and lives saved for alternative PSA screening strategies.
DATA SOURCES: National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, and mortality.
TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary cohort of U.S. men.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: 35 screening strategies that vary by start and stop ages, screening intervals, and thresholds for biopsy referral.
OUTCOME MEASURES: PSA tests, false-positive test results, cancer detected, overdiagnoses, prostate cancer deaths, lives saved, and months of life saved.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without screening, the risk for prostate cancer death is 2.86\%. A reference strategy that screens men aged 50 to 74 years annually with a PSA threshold for biopsy referral of 4 µg/L reduces the risk for prostate cancer death to 2.15\%, with risk for overdiagnosis of 3.3\%. A strategy that uses higher PSA thresholds for biopsy referral in older men achieves a similar risk for prostate cancer death (2.23\%) but reduces the risk for overdiagnosis to 2.3\%. A strategy that screens biennially with longer screening intervals for men with low PSA levels achieves similar risks for prostate cancer death (2.27\%) and overdiagnosis (2.4\%), but reduces total tests by 59\% and false-positive results by 50\%.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Varying incidence inputs or reducing the survival improvement due to screening did not change conclusions.
LIMITATION: The model is a simplification of the natural history of prostate cancer, and improvement in survival due to screening is uncertain.
CONCLUSION: Compared with standard screening, PSA screening strategies that use higher thresholds for biopsy referral for older men and that screen men with low PSA levels less frequently can reduce harms while preserving lives.

The Bayesian method also provides a flexible framework for the monitoring of sequential clinical trials. We present several examples of Bayesian methods in practice including a study of disease progression in AIDS, a comparison of two therapies in a clinical trial, and a case-control study investigating the link between dietary factors and breast cancer.}

Serial terminations during and after stop of promoter treatment with either phenobarbital (PB) or alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) provided information on the growth and regression of the EAF. Simultaneous labeling index (LI) measurements were obtained via single injections with [H-3]thymidine. No significant increases of the LI were observed with PB or alpha-HCH treatment. Since both agents are strong liver promoters we conclude that the growth of gamma-GT-positive foci is mainly due to a decrease in the rate of apoptosis. Indeed, our analysis supports this conclusion but determines that the abrogation of homeostatic control during promoter treatment is subtle. The ratio of cell death and cell birth rate is found to be decreased only slightly during promoter treatment and slightly increased after stop of promotion. For the mathematical analysis, two distinct focal growth scenarios were employed: (i) volume growth, i.e., all cells within individual foci cycle actively with the same rate, and (ii) surface growth where only cells on the surface of foci cycle actively while interior cells are resting. The model based upon scenario (ii) provides a better fit to the data and is more consistent with the experimental observations indicating heterogeneity of cell division rates within individual foci.

If the papers' citation rate is a proxy for their importance, and the threshold for acceptance is unrelated to the country of origin, papers from different countries published in the same journal should have a similar number of citations. Conversely, if the threshold is lowered for some countries, their papers will have a lower mean citation rate. Methods The number of citations and the corresponding author's country were obtained for 4724 papers published between 1998 and 2002 in the British Medical Journal, the Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association and New England Journal of Medicine. Countries were grouped according to the World Bank classification and geographical location: low-middle income countries; high-income European countries; high-income non-European countries; UK and USA. The probability of papers being poorly cited by country of origin was estimated, using domestic papers (British papers published in British journals and US papers published in US journals) as the reference. Results Compared with domestic papers, the OR of being poorly cited was 0.67 (95\% CI 0.55 to 0.81) for papers from high-income European countries, 0.97 (0.76 to 1.24) for papers from high-income non-European countries and 1.93 (1.28 to 2.89) for papers from low-middle income countries.

METHOD: Seventy treatment-naive HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts {\textgreater}50/microL were randomized to receive either zidovudine + lamivudine + nevirapine (AZT + 3TC + NVP), stavudine + didanosine + nevirapine (d4T+ddI+NVP), or stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine (d4T+3TC+NVP) for 52 weeks. Patient assessments were conducted monthly and included measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts and evaluations for drug toxicity. RESULTS: The mean time- weighted reductions in plasma HIV RNA in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 1.29, 2.13, and 1.78 log(10) copies/mL, respectively (p =.389). The proportions of patients with HIV RNA {\textless}50 copies/mL in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 73\%, 68\%, and 80\%, respectively (p =.71). The mean time-weighted increases in CD4+ T-cell counts in the AZT+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+NVP, and d4T+ddI+NVP groups were 139, 113, and 174 cells/microL, respectively (p =.30). Three patients ceased assigned treatment due to rash (one from each treatment arm), and 5 of the 45 patients on d4T (3 from the d4T+3TC+NVP arm and 2 from the d4T+ddI+NVP arm) ceased assigned treatment due to neuropathy. CONCLUSION: All three-drug combinations were equally effective at suppressing viral load and increasing CD4+ T- cell counts. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in virological or immunological response or cessation of study drugs due to adverse events, although it is possible that the study was underpowered to detect differences. NVP was safe and efficacious in this setting, and efficacy was not influenced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 36 clinicians (75\% response) across Australia, of whom 27 were urologists and nine were radiation oncologists, were interviewed in-depth using a key-informant approach. Nine clinicians were from regional Australia, with the remaining 27 from major metropolitan settings. Subsequently, 30 clinicians (69\% response) completed surveys to confirm identified themes. RESULTS: Peer support was rated positively by most clinicians and most report a fair to good knowledge of such groups. However, less than a quarter regularly refer their patients to these groups. While clinicians can describe positive aspects of peer support, many are concerned that biased viewpoints and misinformation within these groups might potentially contribute to patients' decisional uncertainty and regret. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to establish for whom these support groups are most helpful. Concerns about misleading information that might be proffered in support groups is a barrier to clinician referral to these groups. Dialogue between prostate cancer interest groups and clinicians to resolve concerns presents as a key strategy to improve support for men with prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of school foods in 1681 5-12 y old children, 2003-2004. SETTING: Barwon South-Western region of Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: The school food provided an average (+/-s.e.m.) of 3087+/-26 kJ. Bread was the most frequently consumed food and contributed 20\% of total energy at school, biscuits 13\%, fruit 10\%, muesli/fruit bars 8\%, packaged snacks 7\%, and fruit juice/cordial 6\%. About 10\% of children used the school canteen and these children obtained more total energy and more energy from cakes, fast foods and soft drink than noncanteen users (P{\textless}0.001). In all, 68\% of children had fruit in their lunchboxes, however, over 90\% of children had energy-dense, micronutrient-poor snacks ('junk food'). CONCLUSIONS: Fruit intake in primary schools seems reasonably high but could be targeted for further increase as part of promoting a healthy diet. Of concern, however, are the excessive amounts of energy-dense foods in school lunchboxes. These should be considered a priority for health promotion efforts along with reducing the consumption of sweetened drinks. These measures are urgently needed to improve the school-based diets of Australian children and attempt to curb the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity.}

METHODS: Self-reported cervical screening data was extracted from the 1998 NSW Health Survey, biennial screening rates estimated and compared with biennial cervical screening rates for 1997-98, as recorded on the NSW Pap Test Register (PTR). Rates and differences were related to socio-demographic characteristics of the 17 Area Health Services of NSW. RESULTS: According to the 1998 NSW Health Survey, 74\% of women reported having a Pap test during the previous two years. The equivalent rate recorded on the NSW PTR for 1997-98 was 62\% (p{\textless}0.0001). Among the 17 Area Health Services of NSW these differences ranged from nine to 19 percentage points. Area-specific differences between self-reported and registry-based screening rates were negatively correlated with the registry-based screening rate. Age-specific differences between self-reported and registry-based screening rates were positively correlated with registry-based screening rates. No SES, regional or migrant population characteristics were predictive of differences between recorded and surveyed screening rates. CONCLUSION: Cervical screening rates in NSW derived from self-reported survey data exceed the rate recorded by the NSW Pap Test Register by 12 percentage points (equivalent to 19\% inflation). IMPLICATIONS: The data in this paper can be used indicatively where necessary to adjust for over-reporting in cervical cancer screening surveys.}

Out study of this natural experiment aimed to investigate whether the eruption (intervention) had any adverse effect on the health of those people living within the ashfall area, when compared with temporal and spatial controls. The study population comprised those people living in areas receiving {\textgreater} 0.25 mm ashfall, and the control population was unexposed to volcanic ash. Discharge rates from public hospitals were measured for the 3-month period following the eruption and compared with the aggregated corresponding 3-month periods in the previous 7 years. The conditions studied were respiratory disease, stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Analysis used multivariate Poisson regression models, with tests for independence and estimation of interaction effects for change in time before and after the eruption within the study and control areas. The only detrimental effects detected were a borderline increase in acute bronchitis (rate ratio, RR = 1.44. p = 0.031) and conflicting evidence for some cardiovascular diseases. If there were any health effects of exposure to ash following the eruption, these were too small to be clearly evident with this study design. It is therefore unlikely that any such health effects will pose a significant public health problem following similar future eruptions. No targeted public health interventions are therefore indicated beyond those that remove people from the immediate area under direct physical threat from the volcano.}

The date of last medical contact for each case living with AIDS was updated annually. RESULTS: By 30 June 1999, 4814 AIDS cases, diagnosed in Australia in 1991-1996, and 3193 deaths following AIDS had been notified to the National AIDS Registry.

METHODS: The incidence and prevalence of coronary events were estimated using a mathematical method on the basis of official mortality and population data from national statistics and survival data on coronary events from the Area Friuli of the MONICA Project, and forecasted for northern, central and southern Italy. RESULTS: The incidence is described from 1970 to 1994 and projected to the year 2004; prevalence is reported at the years 1990 and 2000. The coronary event incidence has been decreasing since 1977 among men and since 1974, 4 years before the observed mortality decline, among women. The prevalence has continued to increase as a result of three main factors: increasing survival, population aging, and incidence trend. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence and prevalence data distributed for northern, central and southern Italy are essential to plan and implement major projects aimed at improving medical care services and to evaluate the impact of public health interventions and of spontaneously changing habits among the population.}

Control patients were treated by a surgical lung resection mostly because of lung cancer. For chrysotile and other mineral fibers a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) was not observed. A clear dose-response relationship was demonstrated for the concentration CA of amphibole fibers longer than 5 microm. Between 0.025 and 2.5 fibers/microg dry weight (f/microg) the relationship can be approximated as OR = CA/(0. 025 f/microg). Similar but less distinct dose-response relationships were found in a Canadian and an Australian study.

The available data indicate that the overwhelming majority (around 80\%) of people with HCV antibodies were infected through injecting drug use. METHODS: Models of the HCV epidemic in Australia were developed based on estimates of the pattern of injecting drug use in Australia. Estimates of HCV infections due to injecting drug use thus obtained were then adjusted to allow for HCV infections resulting from other transmission routes. Projections of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulting from HCV were obtained by combining modelled HCV incidence with estimates of the progression rates to these outcomes. RESULTS: Based on the models, it was estimated that there were 196,000 (lower and upper limits of 149,000 and 234,000) people in Australia living with HCV antibodies at the end of 1997, with HCV incidence in 1997 estimated to be 11,000 (8500-13,500). It was estimated that 8500 (4000-13,000) people were living with HCV-related cirrhosis in 1997 and that there were 80 (40- 125) incident cases of HCV-related HCC. DISCUSSION: Model-based estimates were broadly consistent with other sources of information on the HCV epidemic in Australia. These models suggest that the prevalence of HCV-related cirrhosis and the incidence of HCV-related HCC will more than double in Australia by 2010},

METHODS: We examined survival trends between the years 2000 and 2004 for 20 common cancers based on follow-up data from 12 cancer registries from diverse areas of Europe using model-based period analysis techniques. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2004, marked rises were seen in 5-year relative survival amongst patients with prostate, breast and colorectal cancer, which were statistically significant in 10, 8 and 7 of the 12 participating cancer registries, respectively. For cancer sites amenable to effective early detection and treatment, major geographical differences in patient prognosis still persisted, with a lower survival generally observed in Eastern European countries. CONCLUSION: Model-based period analysis enables the timely monitoring of recent trends in population-based cancer survival. For colorectal and breast cancers, the identified rises in survival are probably (at least partly) explained by the improvements in clinical care and the management of the disease. Nevertheless, persisting geographic differences do point to the potential for a further reduction in the burden of cancer throughout Europe, towards which improvements in diverse areas of care, including secondary prevention, access to advances in treatment as well as subspecialisation and regionalisation of oncologic care may all contribute.}

RESULTS: We observed a median -2.1 (range: -1; -3.3) log10 copies/ml viral load decrease and a median +158 cells/microl (range: +7 to +316) CD4 cell count increase at week 4 reaching normal CD4 cell count values of 761 CD4 cells/microl (range: 389-1153) at weeks 36-44. Virus undetectability was obtained at week 24 for all subjects. A rapid CD4 T cell amplification involved both memory and naive CD4 T cells. This was associated with a very rapid and significant decrease in activation markers [human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), CD38] on both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets together with a CD8+CD28+ cell increase as early as week 4. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that early therapy with nucleoside analogues can correct the immunological abnormalities observed in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets at the time of PHI. This early kinetics in T cell recovery appears to be faster than in established disease.}

METHODS: Data on the CD4 count at AIDS diagnosis for AIDS cases diagnosed between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997, and reported to the National AIDS Registry in Australia by 31 March 1998, were analysed. The median CD4 count at AIDS diagnosis, and the proportions of AIDS diagnoses with a CD4 count above 100 cells/microl, and above 200 cells/microl, were calculated by the year of diagnosis, both for all AIDS-defining illnesses, and for each illness separately. Analyses were also stratified by the time interval between HIV and AIDS diagnoses (less than or equal to, or more than, 3 months) because people diagnosed with HIV close to the diagnosis of AIDS would generally not have received any antiretroviral treatment before the diagnosis of AIDS, and so no trends in CD4 counts at the diagnosis of AIDS would be expected in this group. RESULTS: There was an increase in CD4 count at AIDS diagnosis in 1996 and 1997, although this increase was only apparent for AIDS-defining illnesses other than Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and was limited to AIDS cases diagnosed with HIV more than 3 months before AIDS. In cases of AIDS other than PCP, and diagnosed with HIV more than 3 months before AIDS, the median CD4 count increased from 50 cells/microl in 1995 to 80 cells/microl in 1996 and 134 cells/microl in 1997. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase in the CD4 count at AIDS diagnosis for most AIDS-defining illnesses in Australia coincident with the widespread availability of HAART},

This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.}

In this study we purposed a four drugs regimen with zidovudine, lamivudine, ritonavir and saquinavir to treat aggressively the infection and achieve a complete immune reconstitution. METHODS: This is an Italian multicentric open label study. Adult patients with PHI were eligible for the study if they met at least one clinical criterion and one laboratory criterion of the following. Clinical criteria: Signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome within the past 70 days, exposure to HIV-1 within the last 3 months, a preceding negative antibody test within the past 6 months. Laboratory criteria: Detectable p24 antigen with neutralization in serum; detectable HIV-RNA in plasma; indeterminate Western blot test with negative or low positive value HIV antibody in ELISA test. RESULTS: Since April 1997 to April 1999 40 patients with PHI have been enrolled; 80\% of this cohort referred symptoms related to acute antiretroviral syndrome. Treatment has been withdrawn in 17 patients (12 for intolerance, 3 for toxicity and 2 for failure). At baseline the mean CD4+ T cells count and CD4/CD8 ratio were 537 (range 55-1287) and 0.58 (range 0.1-1.03) and the mean plasma HIV-RNA level was 5.9 log copies/ml (range 3-7.15). Plasmatic HIV-1 RNA levels of all patients dropped below 200 copies/ml in 68\% of patients at week 12, 81\% at week 24, 93\% after 12 months and 100\% after 18 months. Immunological parameters have been improved and have achieved normal range since 6th month. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid virologic suppression and immunological reconstitution are associated with PHI therapy. However early treatment should be weighted against the potential disadvantages such as immediate adverse events (intolerance and drug toxicity) and long term manifestation (metabolic disorders).}

METHODS: In 1979 all former workers from the Wittenoom asbestos industry who could be traced were sent a questionnaire on smoking history. Of 2928 questionnaires sent, satisfactory replies were received from 2400 men and 149 women. Of the men, 80\% had smoked at some time and 50\% still smoked. Occupational exposure to crocidolite was known from employment records and follow up was maintained through death and cancer registries in Australia with histological diagnoses obtained from the relevant State Cancer Registry. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of tobacco and asbestos exposure on incidence of different cell types of lung cancer in a nested case-control design. RESULTS: Between 1979 and 1990, 71 cases of lung cancer occurred among men in this cohort: 27\% squamous cell carcinoma, 31\% adenocarcinoma, 18\% small cell carcinoma, 11\% large cell carcinoma, and 13\% unclassified or indeterminate. Two of the classified cases and one unclassified case had never smoked. The incidence of both squamous and adenocarcinoma types of lung cancer were greatest in ex-smokers and in those subjects with the highest levels of exposure to crocidolite. After adjustment for smoking habit, the increase in incidence of lung cancer with increasing exposure to crocidolite was greater for squamous cell carcinoma than for adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study have shown significant exposure-response effects for exposure to crocidolite, and both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. They also provide some further evidence against the theory that parenchymal fibrosis induced by asbestos is a necessary precursor to asbestos induced lung cancer.}

Among men, cancer of the lung is the leading cancer site with some 135,000 cases per year followed by prostate, colon and bladder cancer. Breast cancer is the leading site in women, with 135,000 cases per year, followed by colon, stomach and genital cancer. Among men, melanoma of the skin, and lung, pancreas and rectum cancer are more frequent in the north in contrast to larynx, oesophagus, buccal cavity and liver cancer, which are more frequent in the south. There are additional contrasts between Southern European countries. The contrasts are less striking for women. This study provides an estimate of the true number of cases only. The establishment of a network of European cancer registries should eventually lead to more comprehensive incidence information form the EC.}

Through modulation of IGF bioactivity and other mechanisms, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) also have growth-regulatory effects on prostate cells. Recently, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 have been implicated in prostate cancer risk among Western populations. To assess whether IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, or IGFBP-3 are also associated with prostate cancer in a low-risk population, we measured plasma levels of these factors among 128 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases and 306 randomly selected population controls in Shanghai, China. Relative to the lowest quartile of IGF-I levels, men in the highest quartile had a 2.6-fold higher prostate cancer risk, with a significant trend [odds ratio (OR) = 2.63; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.19-5.79; P(trend) = 0.01]. In contrast, men in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 levels had a 46\% decreased risk relative to the lowest quartile (OR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.26-1.15; P(trend) = 0.08). A similar but less distinct result was observed for IGFBP-1 (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI = 0.31-1.17; P(trend) = 0.25). Men in the highest quartile for the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio (an indirect measure of free IGF-I) had a 2.5-fold higher risk compared with the lowest quartile (OR = 2.51; 95\% CI = 1.32-4.75, P(trend) {\textless} 0.001). These associations were more pronounced after adjustment for serum 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol glucuronide and sex hormone-binding globulin levels. There was no significant association with IGF-II levels. Our findings in a low-risk population provide evidence that IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1 are determinants of prostate cancer and indicate that additional studies are needed to evaluate their effects on ethnic and geographic incidence differentials and to elucidate carcinogenic mechanisms.}

The attempt was made regardless of whether the patients had answered passive smoking questions in hospital or not. Amongst lifelong non-smokers, passive smoking was not associated with any significant increase in risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, ischaemic heart disease or stroke in any analysis. Limitations of past studies on passive smoking are discussed and the need for further research underlined. From all the available evidence, it appears that any effect of passive smoke on risk of any of the major diseases that have been associated with active smoking is at most small, and may not exist at all.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has shown to reduce prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial. Overdetection and overtreatment are substantial unfavourable side effects with consequent healthcare costs. In this study the effects of introducing widespread PSA screening is evaluated. METHODS: The MISCAN model was used to simulate prostate cancer growth and detection in a simulated cohort of 100,000 men (European standard population) over 25 years. PSA screening from age 55 to 70 or 75, with 1, 2 and 4-year-intervals is simulated. Number of diagnoses, PSA tests, biopsies, treatments, deaths and corresponding costs for 100,000 men and for United Kingdom and United States are compared. RESULTS: Without screening 2378 men per 100,000 were predicted to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with 4956 men after screening at 4-year intervals. By introducing screening, the costs would increase with 100\% to 60,695,000 euro. Overdetection is related to 39\% of total costs (23,669,000 euro). Screening until age 75 is relatively most expensive because of the costs of overtreatment. CONCLUSION: Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a small part.},

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of incorporating HPV DNA testing into existing cervical cancer screening programs in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, France, and Italy. METHODS: We created a computer-based model of the natural history of cervical carcinogenesis for each using country-specific data on cervical cancer risk and compared each country's current screening policy with two new strategies: 1) cytology throughout a woman's lifetime, using HPV DNA testing as a triage strategy for equivocal cytology results ("HPV triage"), as well as 2) cytology until age 30 years and HPV DNA testing in combination with cytology in women more than 30 years of age ("combination testing"). Outcomes included reduction in lifetime cervical cancer risk, increase in life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expressed as cost per year of life saved. We explored alternative protocols and conducted sensitivity analysis on key parameters of the model over a relevant range of values to identify the most cost-effective options for each country. RESULTS: Both HPV DNA testing strategies, HPV triage and combination testing, were more effective than each country's status quo screening policy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for HPV triage were less than \$13,000 per year of life saved, whereas those for combination testing ranged from \$9800 to \$75,900 per year of life saved, depending on screening interval. We identified options that would be very cost-effective (i.e., cost-effectiveness ratio less than the gross domestic product per capita) in each of the four countries. CONCLUSIONS: HPV DNA testing has the potential to improve health benefits at a reasonable cost compared with current screening policies in four European countries.}

The only type of asbestos used was chrysotile, except during two well-defined periods before 1945 when crocidolite was used, and over 99\% of the population was traced. Compared with national death rates there were no detectable excesses of deaths due to lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, or other cancers; 11 deaths were due to pleural mesothelioma. A case-control study was carried out on deaths due to mesothelioma; this showed that eight workers had been exposed to crocidolite and another was possibly exposed intermittently to crocidolite. The other two had been employed for most of their working lives outside the factory, and their mesotheliomas could not be definitely attributed to exposure to chrysotile. Limiting the study to cases and controls who had exposure to 5 fibres/ml of chrysotile asbestos it was found that five of the six cases compared with two of the 10 controls had also been exposed to crocidolite. The probability (1:36) of this occurring were there no association with crocidolite is most unlikely. A case-control study was also carried out on deaths due to lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer to investigate the dose-response relationships between these tumours and exposure to chrysotile. Measured and estimated fibre concentrations were available for the different jobs over the period of the study. No dose-response relationships were observed, but the exposures were low with only 5\% of men accumulating 100 fibre-years/ml. The experience at this factory over a 40-year period showed that chrysotile asbestos was processed with no detectable excess mortality.}

The framework of Bayesian hierarchical models refers to a generic model building strategy in which unobserved quantities (e.g. statistical parameters, missing or mismeasured data, random effects, etc.) are organized into a small number of discrete levels with logically distinct and scientifically interpretable functions, and probabilistic relationships between them that capture inherent features of the data. It has proved to be successful for analysing many types of complex epidemiological and biomedical data. The general applicability of Bayesian hierarchical models has been enhanced by advances in computational algorithms, notably those belonging to the family of stochastic algorithms based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.In this article, we review different types of design commonly used in studies of environment and health, give details on how to incorporate the hierarchical structure into the different components of the model (baseline risk, exposure) and discuss the model specification at the different levels of the hierarchy with particular attention to the problem of aggregation (ecological) bias.

METHODS: A nested case-control study in a cohort of 3,737 Japanese-American men examined from 1967 to 1970 was conducted in Hawaii (United States). At the time of examination, a single blood specimen was obtained, and the serum was frozen. After a surveillance period of over 23 years, 136 tissue-confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer were identified. Their stored sera and those of 136 matched controls were measured for the following: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone. RESULTS: There were no notable differences between cases and controls in their median serum levels of the five laboratory measurements. Odds ratios (OR) for prostate cancer, based on the quartiles of serum levels in controls, were also determined. The ORs for the highest quartiles relative to the lowest were 0.8 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-1.8) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1.0 (CI = 0.5-2.1) for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. CONCLUSION: It is possible that the lack of sufficient numbers of study subjects with low vitamin D levels affected the results. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that there is a lack of a strong association between vitamin D and prostate cancer.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Any form of screening aims to reduce mortality and increase a person's quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. Much of this debate is due to the limited availability of high quality research and the influence of false-positive or false-negative results generated by use of the diagnostic techniques such as the digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer mortality and has an impact on quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases (PROSTATE register, CENTRAL the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT and the NHS EED) were searched electronically in addition to hand searching of specific journals and bibliographies in an effort to identify both published and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of screening versus no screening or routine care for prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search identified 99 potentially relevant articles that were selected for full text review. From these 99 citations, two randomised controlled trials were identified as meeting the review's inclusion criteria. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials with a total of 55,512 participants were included; however, both trials had methodological weaknesses. Re-analysis using intention-to-screen and meta-analysis of results from the two randomised controlled trials indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between men randomised for prostate cancer screening and controls (RR 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.80-1.29). Neither study assessed the effect of prostate cancer screening on quality of life, all-cause mortality or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given that only two randomised controlled trials were included, and the high risk of bias of both trials, there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of mass, selective or opportunistic screening compared to no screening for reducing prostate cancer mortality. Currently, no robust evidence from randomised controlled trials is available regarding the impact of screening on quality of life, harms of screening, or its economic value. Results from two ongoing large scale multicentre randomised controlled trials that will be available in the next several years are required to make evidence-based decisions regarding prostate cancer screening.}

METHODS: The distribution of ADIs was examined by CCR5 and CCR2b genotype in a subset of homosexual men enrolled in the Sydney AIDS Prospective Study. The expected number of ADIs was calculated from rates observed in the same tertiary hospital over the same period. RESULTS: Information on initial ADI was collected for 117 homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS before January 1998. Of these individuals, 17 were heterozygous for the CCR5-Delta32 mutation and 11 were heterozygous for CCR2b-64I. The number of observed cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and cryptosporidiosis reported as a first ADI was substantially fewer in people heterozygous for the CCR5-Delta32 mutation than for those without the mutation, despite similar age, CD4 T-cell count at AIDS diagnosis, year of AIDS diagnosis and receipt of antiretroviral treatment. In addition, among individuals heterozygous for CCR5-Delta32 there were fewer cases of PCP, toxoplasmosis, MAC, and cryptosporidiosis observed as subsequent ADIs compared to the number expected, based on rates measured in the same hospital during the same period (seven observed vs. 24 expected, RR = 0.3, 95\% CI = 0.01-0.6). The distribution of first and subsequent ADIs did not differ from the number expected in individuals heterozygous for the CCR2b-64I mutation.

This requires sophisticated statistical techniques, usually involving Bayesian models, to smooth the underlying risk estimates because the data are typically sparse. However, questions have been raised about the performance of these models for recovering the "true" risk surface, about the influence of the prior structure specified, and about the amount of smoothing of the risks that is actually performed. We describe a comprehensive simulation study designed to address these questions. Our results show that Bayesian disease-mapping models are essentially conservative, with high specificity even in situations with very sparse data but low sensitivity if the raised-risk areas have only a moderate (less than 2-fold) excess or are not based on substantial expected counts ({\textgreater} 50 per area). Semiparametric spatial mixture models typically produce less smoothing than their conditional autoregressive counterpart when there is sufficient information in the data (moderate-size expected count and/or high true excess risk). Sensitivity may be improved by exploiting the whole posterior distribution to try to detect true raised-risk areas rather than just reporting and mapping the mean posterior relative risk. For the widely used conditional autoregressive model, we show that a decision rule based on computing the probability that the relative risk is above 1 with a cutoff between 70 and 80\% gives a specific rule with reasonable sensitivity for a range of scenarios having moderate expected counts (approximately 20) and excess risks (approximately 1.5- to 2-fold). Larger (3-fold) excess risks are detected almost certainly using this rule, even when based on small expected counts, although the mean of the posterior distribution is typically smoothed to about half the true value.}

Alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency and bronchiectasis had the highest survival gain. Secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis had the lowest survival gain and the lowest gain of quality-adjusted life-years. As compared with COPD/emphysema, alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, and CF had 25\%, 40\% and 19\% more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios, respectively. Cost-utility ratios varied less, with values of -7\%, -14\% and -11\% for alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, and primary pulmonary hypertension, respectively, compared with COPD. In conclusion, our model suggests that there is considerable variation in cost-effectiveness and, to a lesser degree, in cost-utility between the different diagnostic categories.

However, the resource costs (i.e., factors such as physician's time, laboratory tests, patient's time away from work) included in these estimates are unknown. We examined the resource costs for prostate cancer screening, diagnostic tests, and staging; examined how these costs differ in the United States from costs in other industrialized countries; and estimated the cost per man screened for prostate cancer, per man given a diagnostic test, and per man given a clinically staged diagnosis of this disease. METHODS: We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for articles and reports on prostate cancer published from January 1980 through December 2003. Studies were selected according to the following criteria: the article was published in English; the full text was available for review; the study reported the resource or input cost data used to estimate the cost of prostate cancer testing, diagnosing, or clinical staging; and the study was conducted in an established market economy. We used descriptive statistics, weighted mean, and Monte Carlo simulation methods to pool and analyze the abstracted data. RESULTS: Of 262 studies examined, 28 met our selection criteria (15 from the United States and 13 from other industrialized countries). For studies conducted in the United States, the pooled baseline resource cost was \$37.23 for screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and \$31.77 for screening with digital rectal examination (DRE). For studies conducted in other industrialized countries, the pooled baseline resource cost was \$30.92 for screening with PSA and \$33.54 for DRE. For diagnostic and staging methods, the variation in the resource costs between the United States and other industrialized countries was mixed. CONCLUSION: Because national health resources are limited, a decision about whether to invest in early detection of prostate cancer requires an understanding of the factors included in estimates of the economic cost of this disease. This study may benefit health policy makers charged with allocating resources for prostate cancer.}

We identified 318 patients who had endometrial cancer but had no history of bilateral oophorectomy and had been in the Southern California (United States) Kaiser Foundation Health Plan for more than 10 years. For each patient, one or two control members were selected, 599 in all, matched for age and duration of membership at the time of cancer detection and who had had neither hysterectomy nor bilateral oophorectomy. A history of prescriptions for conjugated estrogens and of potential confounders was obtained for each subject by reviewing outpatient medical records. Rate ratios (RR) contrasting users with nonusers were estimated by time of latest prescription. We found that estrogen-induced risk of endometrial cancer decreases rapidly as the estrogen-free interval increases. The RR estimates, adjusted for duration of use and potential confounding factors, declined from 5.0 for those receiving their latest prescription within 24 months (95 percent confidence limits [CL] = 2.6-9.8), to 1.8 for those receiving their latest prescription within 24 to 48 months (CL = 0.9-3.7), to values near one for each latest prescription interval earlier than 48 months ago (P for trend = 0.00004). For those who used conjugated estrogens extensively (five or more prescriptions, five to 10 years ago), the RR estimate declined from 5.1 for those whose latest prescription was within two years to 0.6 yr for those whose latest prescription was four to five years previously (P for trend = 0.05).}

The infection is localized to the cervix and mucosal immunity is likely to be an important determinant for viral clearance. Previous studies of immunity to HPV have measured immune markers in the blood, but the relationship of systemic immunity to cervical immunity is poorly understood. In this study of 70 women enrolled in the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical trial for management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities of the cervix, we collected paired plasma and cervical secretions to investigate the relationship between cervical concentrations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and plasma levels. Neither IL-10 (p = 0.11), or IL-12 (p = -0.04) nor the ratio of IL-12 to IL-10 (p = 0.06) were correlated between blood and cervical secretions. Except for weak correlations of IL-10 among nonsmokers (p = 0.35. P = 0.019) and those in day 18-27 of their menstrual cycle (p = 0.51, P = 0.015), this lack of correlation persisted in all subgroups defined by genital inflammation or infection, current oral contraceptive use, heme contamination and volume of collected secretions, HPV16 seropositivity, and repeat HPV infection and/or cytologic abnormalities. The lack of correlation and high concentrations in cervical secretions indicate that the cervical IL-10 and IL-12 concentrations exceed what could be expected from blood as a principle source of IL-10 and IL-12 and suggest that cytokine concentrations in cervical secretions are predominantly the result of local cytokine production.}

We assessed the use of surveillance and of deferred treatment in a population based, nationwide cohort in Sweden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, with a 98\% coverage vs the compulsory Swedish Cancer Registry, we identified 8,304 incident cases of prostate cancer in 1997 to 2002 with age younger than 70 years, clinical local stage T1 or 2, N0 or Nx, M0 or Mx and serum prostate specific antigen less than 20 ng/ml. Data were extracted from medical charts for 7,782 of these men (94\%) at a median of 4 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: Primary treatment was surveillance for 2,065 men (26\%), radical prostatectomy for 3,722 (48\%), radiotherapy for 1,632 (21\%) and hormonal treatment for 363 (5\%). Men on surveillance had lower local tumor stage, grade and prostate specific antigen, and were older than those who received active primary treatment (p {\textless}0.001). After a median surveillance of 4 years 711 men (34\%) on surveillance had received deferred treatment, which was radical prostatectomy for 279 (39\%), radiotherapy for 212 (30\%) and hormonal treatment for 220 (30\%). CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance was a common treatment for patients younger than 70 years with localized prostate cancer in Sweden in 1997 to 2002, 26\% of men with localized prostate cancer started surveillance and after a median followup of 4 years, 66\% of these men remained on surveillance.},

All cancer cases diagnosed in the Nordic countries during 1958 to 1991/92 were included in the analysis. Relative survival and excess mortality were calculated for intervals in the first five years after diagnosis. Since the 1950s, the prognosis of cancer patients has improved in all the countries, but more moderately in Denmark. For cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, breast (female), and prostate, the Danish patients had a markedly lower relative survival than the patients in the other countries. They also had the lowest proportion of localized tumours. It appears that Danish cancer patients are diagnosed at a later stage of disease than patients in the other Nordic countries.}

Among 191 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases and 304 randomly selected population controls in Shanghai, China, we found no significant association between the BsmI or FokI VDR gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. However, we found that among men with the ff FokI genotype, those in the highest tertile of plasma IGFBP-3 had a decreased risk versus those in the lowest tertile (odds ratio, 0.14; 95\% confidence interval, 0.04-0.56; P(trend) {\textless} 0.01), whereas among men with the FF and Ff genotypes, IGFBP-3 was not associated with risk. Similarly, IGFBP-1 was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk only among men with the ff FokI genotype (odds ratio, 0.25; 95\% confidence interval, 0.07-0.85; P(trend) = 0.02). No such FokI genotype-specific effects were observed for IGF-I or IGF-II. Our findings in a low-risk population suggest that the IGF and vitamin D regulatory systems may interact to affect prostate cancer risk. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and clarify the underlying mechanisms.}

We attempted to determine whether the link is sufficiently strong that the wide inter-person variability in times from HIV infection to AIDS can be explained solely by differences in CD4 count experience. METHODS: We followed 1090 HIV-infected individuals for up to 12.8 years from seroconversion (median, 3.5 years; 25\% for more than 5.2 years). The median interval between last negative and first positive anti-HIV tests was 9 months. A median of four CD4 counts per subject were measured. RESULTS: Individuals with CD4 lymphocyte counts above 250 x 10(6)/l cells experienced an AIDS incidence rate of one per 339 years (0.3 per 100 years; 10 cases in 3394 person-years), compared with one per 6 years in those whose count had declined below this level (17.2 per 100 years; 96 cases in 559 person-years) and one per year in those whose count had declined below 50 x 10(6)/l (100.0 per 100 years; 41 cases in 41 person-years). The AIDS rate increased by an average of 33\% [relative rate, 1.33; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-1.49; P = 0.0001] with every year from seroconversion; one per 46 years (2.2 per 100 years) for people seropositive for less than 5 years compared with one per 14 years (7.3 per 100 years) for those seropositive for more than 5 years. After adjusting for the tendency for CD4 lymphocyte counts to be higher soon after seroconversion, the relative rate declined to 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.22) per year from seroconversion (P = 0.32). This result was similar when those infected through sharing injecting equipment, homosexual sex, and other routes were considered separately. The relative rate per year from seroconversion for death due to AIDS fell from 1.41 (P = 0.0001) to 1.00 (P = 0.99) after adjusting for CD4 count. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the inter-person variability in time from HIV infection to AIDS appears to result from differences in CD4 lymphocyte counts. HIV infection appears to cause AIDS and death largely by its ability to induce CD4 lymphocytopaenia or some closely correlated abnormality},

Overall, liver cancer is the most frequent malignancy, but there are large regional differences in incidence and in histological type, with very high rates of cholangiocarcinoma in the northeast (associated with endemic opisthorchiasis) but a more even distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma. Lung cancer is second in frequency, with the highest rates in northern Thailand, where the incidence in women (Age Standardized Rate, 37.4 per 100,000) is among the highest in the world. A link with tobacco smoking is suggested by similarly raised rates, especially in women, for cancers of the larynx and pancreas. Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy in women, with relatively little regional variation in risk, while the incidence of breast cancer is low. Other cancer sites showing moderately increased rates include the lip and oral cavity, particularly in females from the north and northeast, where the chewing of betel nut remains common among older generations, nasopharyngeal cancer, carcinoma of the esophagus in the southern region, and penile cancer, especially in the north and northeast.

	annote = {Efforts to elucidate the causes of prostate cancer have met with little success to date. All that is known with certainty is that the incidence increases exponentially with age, varies by geography and by race or ethnicity, and is higher among men whose father or brother had the disease. Because the incidence changes in migrants and their offspring, exogenous factors certainly contribute to the risk of prostate cancer. Early epidemiologic studies implicated dietary fat as a likely causal factor for this cancer. However, scientific support for such an association has diminished in recent years as more epidemiologic evidence has accrued. Accordingly, we reviewed the relevant English language literature on this topic, including epidemiologic and animal studies, as well as current concepts regarding the involvement of fat in carcinogenesis to re-examine the fat-prostate cancer hypothesis. We conclude that dietary fat may indeed be related to prostate cancer risk, although the specific fat components that are responsible are not yet clear. Given the diverse effects of fatty acids on cellular biology and chemistry, it seems likely that the relationship is complex, involving the interplay of fat with other dietary factors, such as antioxidant vitamins and minerals, or with genetic factors that influence susceptibility. Some suggestions for further research are offered.}

To construct a database for clinical epidemiological prostate cancer research based on linkages between the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden, a population-based, nationwide quality database, and other nationwide registries. Material and methods . By use of the individually unique Swedish Personal Identity Number, the NPCR was linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Register, the Prescribed Drug Register, the National Patient Register and the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register, all held at the Centre for Epidemiology at the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Register of the Total Population, the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies and the Multi-Generation Register, held at Statistics Sweden, and to the Swedish Hernia Register. Results. Record linkages between the NPCR and the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Register and the Register of the Total Population generated a database, named PCBaSe Sweden, including 80 079 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006. Record linkage between PCBaSe Sweden and the Prescribed Drug Register generated 59 721 unique matches and linkage to the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register resulted in 11 459 matches. Conclusion . PCBaSe Sweden is a newly created and unique database with over 80 000 cases of prostate cancer with comprehensive data on inpatient and outpatient care, patterns of use of prescribed drugs and socioeconomic and familial factors. Many topics in clinical prostate cancer epidemiology can be investigated. using PCBaSe Sweden.}

AIMS: To examine social determinants of mental disorders and attempted suicide in Australia. METHOD: Data from the 1997 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (n=10 641) were used to estimate associations between socio-economic status, mental disorders and attempted suicide. Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, urban/rural residence and country of birth. Socio-economic status differentials in suicide attempts were also adjusted for mental disorders. RESULTS: Significant increasing gradients from high to low levels of education and occupational status (employed) were evident for affective disorders and anxiety disorders in both men and women and for substance use disorders in men. Similar gradients were found for suicide attempts, which decreased after adjusting for mental disorders, but remained significant in the working-age employed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest social causation of mental disorders and suicide attempts, and the need for social and economic responses beyond provision of mental health services.}

	issn = {1873-7560},
	doi = {10.1016/j.eururo.2013.12.058},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is hampered by an inability to predict who has the potential to develop fatal disease and who has indolent cancer. Studies have identified multiple genetic risk loci for PCa incidence, but it is unknown whether they could be used as biomarkers for PCa-specific mortality (PCSM).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of 47 established PCa risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCSM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 10 487 men who had PCa and 11 024 controls, with a median follow-up of 8.3 yr, during which 1053 PCa deaths occurred.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The main outcome was PCSM. The risk allele was defined as the allele associated with an increased risk for PCa in the literature. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios of each SNP with time to progression to PCSM after diagnosis. We also used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for each risk SNP, comparing fatal PCa cases to controls.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among the cases, we found that 8 of the 47 SNPs were significantly associated (p{\textless}0.05) with time to PCSM. The risk allele of rs11672691 (intergenic) was associated with an increased risk for PCSM, while 7 SNPs had risk alleles inversely associated (rs13385191 [C2orf43], rs17021918 [PDLIM5], rs10486567 [JAZF1], rs6465657 [LMTK2], rs7127900 (intergenic), rs2735839 [KLK3], rs10993994 [MSMB], rs13385191 [C2orf43]). In the case-control analysis, 22 SNPs were associated (p{\textless}0.05) with the risk of fatal PCa, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. Rs11672691 and rs10993994 were associated with both fatal and nonfatal PCa, while rs6465657, rs7127900, rs2735839, and rs13385191 were associated with nonfatal PCa only.
CONCLUSIONS: Eight established risk loci were associated with progression to PCSM after diagnosis. Twenty-two SNPs were associated with fatal PCa incidence, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. The relatively small magnitudes of the associations do not translate well into risk prediction, but these findings merit further follow-up, because they may yield important clues about the complex biology of fatal PCa.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we assessed whether established PCa risk variants could predict PCSM. We found eight risk variants associated with PCSM: One predicted an increased risk of PCSM, while seven were associated with decreased risk. Larger studies that focus on fatal PCa are needed to identify more markers that could aid prediction.},

Part of the impetus is statistical and derives from weaknesses in Canada's health statistics programme--particularly the lack of balance between information on health outcomes and health care resource consumption, and the absence of a coherent statistical structure. The other major impetus is the need for rational processes for managing and allocating resources to improve the health of Canadians. The foundation for the development of this model has come from the revolution in computing. Dramatic improvements have opened up new methodological opportunities, particularly sophisticated simulation modelling and detailed analyses of large volumes of microdata. POHEM is designed to build on these increasingly powerful methods in order to meet health statistical and policy needs. At this time, POHEM is like a partially-completed building. This article reviews its motivation, the overall architectural plan, and the portion of the structure already completed. A major portion of POHEM is devoted to the explicit modelling of chronic disease processes, using monte carlo microsimulation methods. The article concludes with illustrations of a few recent applications, focusing on the joint patterns of smoking, cholesterol and heart disease, osteoarthritis and lung cancer morbidity. While POHEM has been developed in a Canadian context, work is under way to create a version that can be used in other countries.}

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the efficacy of a second-generation assay by hybrid capture (HC II) to detect carcinogenic HPV from residual cervical cells of a liquid-based cervical cytologic specimen, and (2) to compare the performance of this second-generation test with the first-generation hybrid capture (HCT) HPV test of material from direct cervical sampling to detect CIN in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Papanicolaou (Pap) smear reports. METHODS: Women with a recent Pap smear report of ASCUS or LSIL had a sampling of the cervix using either an Ayre's spatula and cytobrush or an Accellon device sampling for liquid-based cytologic system HC II HPV testing, followed by a Dacron swab sampling of the cervix for standard HCT HPV testing of the paired specimens. All women received colposcopy examinations including cervical biopsy and endocervical curettage, when indicated, to determine criterion standards for comparison. RESULTS: Paired swabs and liquid-based cervical specimens from 242 women were available for testing by standard HCT and the newer HC II HPV DNA assays. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detecting CIN grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2/3) were 61.9\%, 57.0\%, 12.0\%, and 94.0\%, respectively, for the HCT test, and 90.5\%, 29.4\%, 10.9\%, and 97.0\%, respectively, for the liquid-based cytology HC II assay. When only women with an initial ASCUS Pap smear report were considered, the HC II test results were 88.9\%, 40.3\%, 9.1\%, and 98.2\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for lower genital tract carcinogenic HPV DNA using a cervical cytology liquid transport media residual sample is clinically feasible. The new HC II microplate HPV test achieved a greater test sensitivity for detecting carcinogenic HPV and correspondingly of CIN 2/3 compared with the currently available first-generation HC HPV test. Use of a liquid-based cervical cytology system combined with intermediate triage by HC II testing of residual cells for carcinogenic HPV alone may help to efficiently identify CIN 2/3 in women who have a prior screening Pap smear report of ASCUS.}

Observed results in Navarra, consisting of more than 100,000 screens, were compared with expected results. A microsimulation screening analysis model was used that included demographical, epidemiological and screening characteristics of Navarra. Alternative assumptions on epidemiological and screening characteristics were also addressed. The observed detection rate (5.9 per 1,000 screened women) in the first round was 18\% higher than expected; the observed rate in the subsequent round (2.9) was 17\% lower than expected. Longer pre-clinical durations, lower sensitivity or the existence of a high-risk group in Navarra could not satisfactorily explain the first and second round results together. Nevertheless, the programme will have an important health benefit for the women involved, due to an important trend in incidence in recent years and the relatively unfavourable clinical stage distribution in Navarra. The proportion T2+ cancers that will be prevented after 10 years of screening amounts to 36\%. The annual mortality reduction in steady state is expected to range between 17\% (if the observed rates in the second round indicate real screening performance) to 23\% (if the first round indicates real performance). Our results demonstrate that a high detection rate in the first round is insufficient to evaluate the quality of a programme. Interval cancer rates, results of the subsequent round and size distributions are also crucial indicators of the quality of the screening programme and should be analysed in their specific context.}

The object of the present review was to ascertain how much reliance can reasonably be put on clinical diagnoses made and death certificates completed in the absence of autopsy data. In the case of lung cancer, high rates of false positive and false negative diagnoses are universally prevalent, with biases influencing these rates, so that smokers are more likely to be appropriately investigated for lung cancer, and false negatives are commoner in non-smokers. All investigators who have compared clinical-based and autopsy-based death certificates have concluded that higher autopsy rates are necessary and the results of one study suggest that a high autopsy rate in a hospital leads to improvements in the accuracy of clinical diagnoses. The extent to which diagnoses on death certificates that are dependent solely on clinical data are seriously inaccurate for internal diseases such as lung cancer should engender caution in all who use mortality data to guide public health policies and to identify and quantify environmental risks to healths.}

Durable suppression reduced levels of HIV-1-specific antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in selected subjects. Proviral DNA in mononuclear cells uniformly persisted. The persistence of HIV-1 RNA expression in lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggests that elimination of this residual pool of virus should be achieved before considering adjustments in antiretroviral therapeutic regimens. In addition, given the reduction in levels of virus-specific immune responses, it would seem prudent to consider enhancing these responses using vaccine strategies prior to the withdrawal of antiviral therapy.}

METHODS: We demonstrate the application of a flexible, yet parsimonious, spline function model to investigate latency patterns for radon progeny exposure and lung cancer in the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The model extends a previously proposed bilinear model. RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) reached a maximum of 0.6 per 100 working level months, for exposures received 14 years previously. The ERR then declined, and was estimated to approach zero for exposures received 35 years and more in the past. The point-wise 95\% confidence intervals supported ERRs {\textgreater} 0 for the period 9-32 years before the event. The estimated latency curve was homogeneous across categories of attained age, duration of exposure, rate of exposure, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed spline model is a flexible tool for latency analyses, and extends previously used methods.}

Using the example of HIV testing, the authors explore the optimal targeting of funds within this pathway. METHODS: The authors develop a microsimulation of HIV testing services and decompose the likelihood that an unidentified HIV-infected person will receive care into the probability of testing [P(test)] and the probability of follow-up [P(follow)] defined as returning for results and linking to care. The authors examine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative investments in these component probabilities. RESULTS: At 1\% undiagnosed HIV prevalence, cost-effectiveness ratios for HIV testing cluster around \$33,000/QALY (quality-adjusted life year) gained. A program with a yield of 0.16 via P(test)=0.20 and P(follow)=0.80 has a cost-effectiveness ratio of \$32,900/QALY compared with \$36,300/QALY for a program where P(test)=0.80 and P(follow)=0.20. Interventions that improve the probability of success in later stages in the testing pathway [P(follow)] are more cost-effective than investments devoted to earlier stages [P(test)]. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent pathway outcomes in a screening program do not confer equal value. Limited screening resources are best targeted toward returning for results and linkage among those already identified with disease rather than offering testing to additional people.}

Individual factors were more important predictors of smoking behaviors than were contextual factors. Predictors of smoking behaviors were mostly common across racial/ethnic groups.Conclusions.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 28 patients selected, four were untreated, four received ZDV alone, 10 received a triple combination (ZDV, lamivudine (3TC) and saquinavir (SQV)) and 10 received a quadruple combination (ZDV, 3TC, SQV and ritonavir (RTV)). Seroconversion was monitored by means of Western blot profile analysis. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in the HIV gag region was used to monitor viral DNA and the nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) system for viraemia (HIV-RNA). RESULTS: There was a certain level of heterogeneity in the baseline values of HIV-DNA and RNA. Early HAART led to a rapid recovery in the number of CD4 cells and the CD4/CD8 cell ratio and a reduction in HIV-RNA to undetectable levels, which was significantly greater than in the untreated patients or those treated with ZDV. Although a reduction in DNA levels was also observed in the HAART-treated subjects, this variation was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The parameters of viral replication and CD4 cell recovery were only slightly better in the patients receiving ZDV monotherapy than in the untreated patients, thus confirming that the course of the infection is hardly affected by the monotherapy. The early introduction of HAART greatly reduces plasma viraemia and restores the number of CD4 cells for up to 1 year. HIV-DNA remains detectable, although at low levels, thus confirming that the early established reservoir of infected cells is little affected. Longer periods of observation and the introduction of complementary approaches, such as immunomodulatory therapies, will provide further information concerning the possibility of radically interfering with the natural evolution of the disease.}

METHOD: Unit record data for females with the variables of interest were extracted from the 1989/90 and 1995 NHS and combined. The dichotomous outcome variables were 'ever had a Pap test' and 'had a Pap test within three years'. The principal study factor was country-of-birth, but language spoken at home (English or not) was also examined. The indirect age-standardised screening ratio was used to calculate proportions of 'ever had a Pap test' and 'had a Pap test within three years' and differences were tested statistically using logistic regression analysis for each year of survey by migrant status. RESULTS: Odds ratios for rates of reporting 'ever had a Pap test' were significantly lower in women born in southern Europe, Italy, other countries, southern Asia, Middle East, Greece and South-East Asia compared with Australian-born. Reported rates of 'ever had a Pap test' were significantly higher in the 1995 NHS (p{\textless}0.001). There were significant increases in screening for the Australian-born, New Zealand-born, and women born in southern Europe, South-East Asia, South Asia and Italy, and both English and non-English speakers over the 1989/90 and 1995 NHSs. Odds ratios for reporting 'had a Pap test within three years' showed significantly lower ORs for women born in the UK, Other countries, Middle East, Greece, and South-East Asia compared with the Australian-born. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals differentials in reported Pap test behaviour by country-of-birth in Australia and that reported screening rates have improved from the 1989/90 NHS to 1995 NHS in most country-of-birth groups.}

METHODS: A representative sample population (n=5990) of Australian men ({\textgreater}or=40 years) was obtained by contacting a random selection of households with unbiased sampling, stratified by age and state. A 20-min computer-assisted telephone interview was done to assess reproductive health and related knowledge and beliefs, sociodemographic factors, general health, and lifestyle factors. FINDINGS: A response rate of 78\% (5990/7636) was achieved. 34\% (1627/4737) of men surveyed reported one or more reproductive health disorder, all of which were most common in the oldest age group. Age-standardised prevalence of significant lower urinary tract symptoms was 16\%, erectile dysfunction was 21\%, and prostate disease was 14\%. About 50\% of participants reported having had a prostate cancer test whereas only 30\% (300/1012) of men with erectile dysfunction sought medical help. Willingness to seek medical help for erectile dysfunction was related to age and ethnic origin. Although men aged 40-69 years expressed a moderate or high level of concern about prostate cancer and loss of erectile function, concern about reproductive health was less in the oldest age group ({\textgreater}or=70 years). INTERPRETATION: The high prevalence of reproductive health disorders and associated concerns in middle-aged and older Australian men draws attention to the need to develop appropriate services and education strategies specifically directed to improving reproductive health in these men.},

RESULTS: QAMA-funded researchers put forth several myths purporting that Quebec-mined chrysotile was harmless, and contended that the contamination of chrysotile with oils, tremolite, or crocidolite was the source of occupational health risk. In addition, QAMA-funded researchers manipulated data and used unsound sampling and analysis techniques to back up their contention that chrysotile was "essentially innocuous." CONCLUSIONS: These studies were used to promote the marketing and sales of asbestos, and have had a substantial effect on policy and occupational health litigation.

Some population-based studies on cancer patients support the idea of the role of gender in predicting survival. However, the data are somewhat contrasting and inconclusive. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the prognostic role of gender for cancer patients, making use of the large set of survival data made available by the EUROCARE II project for the period 1985-1989. By applying a multivariate approach the major confounders such as age, geographical area and cancer site were considered in analysing survival data on more than 1 million cancer cases collected by 45 population-based cancer registries in 17 European countries. The results were consistent with the general observation that in the industrialised countries women tend to survive longer than men. The multivariate analysis showed better survival from cancer in women than in men, estimated as an overall 2\% lower relative risk of dying. The female advantage was particularly evident in young cases, reduced in patients in middle age groups and in the oldest patients completely reversed so that at this age men had the better prognosis. Longer survival for women was not present immediately after diagnosis, but the major advantage was seen after 3 years of follow-up. The risk of death for women was significantly lower for cancer of the head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, liver and pancreas. For bladder cancer, the risk of death was significantly greater for women. These results can be explained by gender differences in sub-site distributions (head and neck and stomach) and by the differences in the stage at diagnosis (presumably bladder). However, the consistency of the data, evident only when a vast set of data is analysed, suggest that women may be intrinsically more robust than men in coping with cancer.}

Although some countries have changed to liquid-based cytology for cervical screening, controversy remains. We reviewed the published work to assess the performance of liquid-based cytology relative to conventional cytology in primary studies assessed to be of low, medium, or high methodological quality. METHODS: 56 primary studies were reviewed and assessed with strict methodological criteria. Liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology were compared in terms of the percentage of slides classified as unsatisfactory, the percentage of slides classified in each cytology category, and the accuracy of detection of high-grade disease. Data were examined for studies overall and in strata to examine the effect of study quality on results. FINDINGS: The median difference in the percentage of unsatisfactory slides between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology was 0.17\%. Only one small study was a randomised controlled trial. The classification of high-grade squamous epithelial lesion varied according to study quality (p=0.04), with conventional cytology classifying more slides in this category than did liquid-based cytology in high-quality studies (n=3) only. In medium-quality (n=30) and high-quality studies, liquid-based cytology classified more slides as atypical squamous cells of unknown significance than did conventional cytology when compared with low-quality studies (n=17; p=0.05). Only four studies provided sufficient verified data to allow estimation of sensitivity and specificity and comparison of test accuracy. INTERPRETATION: We saw no evidence that liquid-based cytology reduced the proportion of unsatisfactory slides, or detected more high-grade lesions in high-quality studies, than conventional cytology. This review does not lend support to claims of better performance by liquid-based cytology. Large randomised controlled trials are needed.}

DESIGN: Analysis of data from 984 patients with a median follow-up of 21 months enrolled in EuroSIDA. Patients started their second PI-containing regimen at least 16 weeks after starting the first PI-containing regimen and with viral load {\textgreater} 1000 copies/ml. METHODS: Virological response was defined as a viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml and immunological response as an increase of 50 x 10(6)/l or more in CD4 lymphocyte count. RESULTS: The median CD4 cell count at starting the second PI was 171 x 10(6) cells/l; viral load was 4.45 log copies/ml. As a second PI regimen, 45\% were using a dual PI, while of those on one PI, indinavir (42\%) and nelfinavir (34\%) were most common. In multivariate Cox models, a higher viral load at starting the second PI [relative hazard (RH), 0.67 per 1 log higher; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.77; P {\textless} 0.0001) and a lower CD4 cell count (RH, 1.15 per 50\% higher; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.26; P = 0.0014) were associated with a reduced probability of virological response. Those who had achieved viral suppression on the first PI-regimen were more likely to respond to the second (RH, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.30-2.10; P {\textless} 0.0001) as were those who added one or two new nucleosides to their second PI. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who initiate a second PI regimen at lower viral load, higher CD4 cell count or who added new nucleosides tended to be more likely to achieve a viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml. The roles of cross-resistance and adherence in response to second-line regimens needs further investigation},

Using data from the Thames and Finnish Cancer Registries we obtained five-year relative survival estimates for 12 cancer sites, excluding DCOs as usual. We then made adjustments to allow for the effects of both the known proportion of DCOs and the estimated proportion of missing cases for each site. In general, adjusting for DCOs led to lower survival estimates, whilst adjusting for incompleteness had the opposite effect. The Finnish data were largely complete and had small proportions of DCOs, and hence the adjustments had little effect on estimated survival. The changes in the Thames estimates were more marked. When performing cohort survival analysis (based on diagnoses between 1990 and 1994), the increases in the survival estimates gained from adjusting for incompleteness were for the most part offset by the decrease produced when adjusting for DCOs. However, when performing period survival analysis based on the period 1997-2001 (when the DCO rate at Thames had fallen by around a half relative to the earlier period), the final estimates (adjusted for both effects) were generally higher than the unadjusted values--thus reducing the apparent difference between the two countries. It is important to take variations in DCO proportion and/or completeness into consideration when comparing survival estimates between different populations.},

Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were measured frequently and the results were fitted to mathematical models. HIV-1 RNA levels were also monitored in nine patients given two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a protease inhibitor after a median of 7 days from the onset of PHI illness. RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA appeared in the blood during the week preceding onset of PHI illness and increased rapidly during the first viremic phase, reaching a peak at a mean of 7 days after onset of illness. This was followed by a phase of rapidly decreasing levels of HIV-1 RNA to an average of 21 days after onset. Viral density continued to decline thereafter but at a 5- to 50-fold lower rate; a steady-state level was reached at a median of 2 months after onset of PHI. Peak viral density levels correlated significantly with levels measured between days 50 and 600. Initiation of antiretroviral treatment during PHI resulted in rapidly declining levels to below 50 copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the kinetic phases of viremia during PHI and indicates two new contributions to the natural history of HIV-1 infection: PHI peak levels correlate with steady-state levels and HIV-1 RNA declines biphasically; an initial rapid decay is usually followed by a slow decay, which is similar to the initial changes seen with antiviral treatment.}

In this trial, prostate cancer prevalence was reduced by 25\%; however, an increase in the number of high-grade tumors among the treatment group necessitates the long-term projection of the likely benefits and costs. METHODS: We use a Markov decision analysis model with data from the trial, the SEER program, and published literature. The model measures the cost per life-year and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for a cohort of men age 55 years who initiate preventive treatment with finasteride. RESULTS: Finasteride is associated with a gain of 6 life-years per 1000 men treated at an incremental cost of 1660000 dollars per life-year gained. The quality-adjusted analysis results in 46 QALYs gained per 1000 men treated at an incremental cost of 200000 dollars per QALY gained, due primarily to the favorable effects of finasteride on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Under the assumption that the increase in high-grade tumors observed among finasteride treated men is a pathologic artifact, the incremental costs are 290000 dollars per life-year gained and 130000 dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The cost burden associated with finasteride is substantial, while its survival benefit is small and only realized many years after initiating treatment. To achieve an incremental cost below 100000 dollars per QALY gained, the price of finasteride must be reduced by 50\% from its current average wholesale price and finasteride must be shown to prevent high-grade as well as low-grade disease.}

Judging by consistency, the full series method performed as well as either of the other methods when assessing radiographic changes and significantly better when assessing the level of profusion of small opacities. There was little to choose between the other two methods either judging by consistency or repeatability, which could not be estimated for the full series method.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

For men with localised prostate cancer, surgery provides a survival benefit compared with watchful waiting. Treatments are associated with morbidity. Results for functional outcome and quality of life are rarely reported beyond 10 years and are lacking from randomised settings. We report results for quality of life for men in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) after a median follow-up of more than 12 years.


METHODS

All living Swedish and Finnish men (400 of 695) randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting in SPCG-4 from 1989 to 1999 were included in our analysis. An additional 281 men were included in a population-based control group matched for region and age. Physical symptoms, symptom-induced stress, and self-assessed quality of life were evaluated with a study-specific questionnaire. Longitudinal data were available for 166 Swedish men who had answered quality-of-life questionnaires at an earlier timepoint.


FINDINGS

182 (88\%) of 208 men in the radical prostatectomy group, 167 (87\%) of 192 men in the watchful-waiting group, and 214 (76\%) of 281 men in the population-based control group answered the questionnaire. Men in SPCG-4 had a median follow-up of 12·2 years (range 7-17) and a median age of 77·0 years (range 61-88). High self-assessed quality of life was reported by 62 (35\%) of 179 men allocated radical prostatectomy, 55 (34\%) of 160 men assigned to watchful waiting, and 93 (45\%) of 208 men in the control group. Anxiety was higher in the SPCG-4 groups (77 [43\%] of 178 and 69 [43\%] of 161 men) than in the control group (68 [33\%] of 208 men; relative risk 1·42, 95\% CI 1·07-1·88). Prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 84\% (146 of 173 men) in the radical prostatectomy group, 80\% (122 of 153) in the watchful-waiting group, and 46\% (95 of 208) in the control group and prevalence of urinary leakage was 41\% (71 of 173), 11\% (18 of 164), and 3\% (six of 209), respectively. Distress caused by these symptoms was reported significantly more often by men allocated radical prostatectomy than by men assigned to watchful waiting. In a longitudinal analysis of men in SPCG-4 who provided information at two follow-up points 9 years apart, 38 (45\%) of 85 men allocated radical prostatectomy and 48 (60\%) of 80 men allocated watchful waiting reported an increase in number of physical symptoms; 50 (61\%) of 82 and 47 (64\%) of 74 men, respectively, reported a reduction in quality of life.


INTERPRETATION

For men in SPCG-4, negative side-effects were common and added more stress than was reported in the control population. In the radical prostatectomy group, erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage were often consequences of surgery. In the watchful-waiting group, side-effects can be caused by tumour progression. The number and severity of side-effects changes over time at a higher rate than is caused by normal ageing and a loss of sexual ability is a persistent psychological problem for both interventions. An understanding of the patterns of side-effects and time dimension of their occurrence for each treatment is important for full patient information.

An example of this is in prostate cancer screening, where additional markers have been sought to improve the specificity of the conventional Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test. A marker of particular interest is the percent free PSA. Studies evaluating the benefits of percent free PSA reflect the need for a methodological approach that is statistically valid and useful in the clinical setting. This article presents methods that address this need. We focus on and-or combinations of biomarker results that we call logic rules and present novel definitions for the ROC curve and the area under the curve (AUC) that are applicable to this class of combination tests. Our estimates of the ROC and AUC are amenable to statistical inference including comparisons of tests and regression analysis. The methods are applied to data on free and total PSA levels among prostate cancer cases and matched controls enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study.}

Inclusion criteria were more than 20 cases of chronic HCV infection, and information on either age of subjects or duration of infection. Of 145 studies examined, 57 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Least-squares linear regression was employed to estimate rates of progression to cirrhosis, and to examine for factors associated with more rapid disease progression in 4 broad study categories: 1) liver clinic series (number of studies = 33); 2) posttransfusion cohorts (n = 5); 3) blood donor series (n = 10); and 4) community-based cohorts (n = 9). Estimates of progression to cirrhosis after 20 years of chronic HCV infection were 22\% (95\% CI, 18\%-26\%) for liver clinic series, 24\% (11\%-37\%) for posttransfusion cohorts, 4\% (1\%- 7\%) for blood donor series, and 7\% (4\%-10\%) for community-based cohorts. Factors that were associated with more rapid disease progression included older age at HCV infection, male gender, and heavy alcohol intake. Even after accounting for these factors, progression estimates were much higher for cross-sectional liver clinic series. Selection biases probably explain the higher estimates of disease progression in this group of studies.

To the authors' knowledge, there is only limited evidence to support this belief. METHODS: For 5055 women in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)-Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), the Pap interval was defined as the number of days between the referral Pap smear demonstrating ASCUS or LSIL ("first cytology") and the enrollment liquid-based ("repeat") cytology. The authors investigated the influence of the interval between Pap smears on repeat cytology by examining percentages of abnormal findings, cellularity, and test sensitivity among women diagnosed with histologic grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) during the 2-year course of the ALTS. In addition, because human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA adjunct testing is now performed, the authors evaluated HPV viral load, which was assayed using residual liquid cytology specimens, in women with CIN3. RESULTS: The Pap interval ranged from 8-30 days in 763 women, 31-60 days in 2317 women, 61-90 days in 1090 women, 91-120 days in 491 women, and 121-184 days in 394 women (mean of 61.3 days; standard deviation of 34 days). Repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, ASCUS, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not appear to vary among the Pap interval groups. However, low-grade cytologic regression occurred with an increasing Pap interval; negative cytology increased from 28.3\% (8-30 days) to 41.6\% (121-184 days) (P {\textless} 0.0001) whereas LSIL cytology decreased (P trend = 0.002). The approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8-30 days (P trend = 0.04). Among women with CIN3, the repeat test sensitivity at a threshold of ASCUS or greater and the HPV DNA viral load was not found to vary by Pap interval (P trend = 0.80 and P trend = 0.36, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that a short Pap interval (range, 15-120 days) does not significantly affect the quality of liquid-based repeat cytology, nor the viral load tested from a residual liquid-based specimen.

National population-based registries of AIDS and HIV diagnoses to August 1999 were matched separately with the National Cancer Registry in Australia. Four analyses were performed. In analysis 1, follow-up was from 5 years before AIDS registration in 8,118 persons with AIDS. Analysis 2 was similar but adjusted expected numbers of cancers for decreased survival. Analysis 3 was based on 7,061 persons registered with HIV, with follow-up from the reported date of diagnosis. Analysis 4 was based on 2,112 AIDS cases previously reported with HIV, with follow-up from 5 years before AIDS diagnosis. In all analyses, follow-up ended at cancer diagnosis, death, 6 months before AIDS, or the end of available cancer data, whichever occurred first. For 10 types of cancer there were at least three cases in any one of the analyses. For these cancers there was no systematic pattern such that one analysis produced consistently higher or lower estimates than the others. These analyses suggest that cancer risk in persons with HIV before AIDS diagnosis may be estimated reliably based on cancer experience 5 years before AIDS},

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate carcinoma from October 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992 in New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut, were identified. Data were collected through standardized outpatient medical record review. Multivariate statistical methods were used to determine the factors that independently predicted the frequency of surveillance. RESULTS: Six hundred fifty-eight men with localized prostate carcinoma were included in the cohort. Forty-five percent of all patients were tested at least once annually, and 69\% were tested at least once every 2 years. Multivariate models indicated that African American men were half as likely as Caucasian men to receive annual testing (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.97). Men diagnosed at age 70 years or older were 38\% less likely to have annual testing than men diagnosed between the ages of 65 and 69 (OR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.94). A higher Gleason score and PSA at presentation also were associated independently with higher rates of annual PSA surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Postdiagnosis PSA surveillance is common, although not universal. African American men were at significantly greater risk for receiving less frequent testing compared with Caucasian men. This disparity in access to care may explain, in part, previously observed racial differences in survival in prostate carcinoma. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for the racial disparity in PSA surveillance and to design interventions to lessen these differences.}

Other solutions can be expressed in terms of these components, and they can also be used to understand both subgroup and temporal interactions. One approach that may offer a way of understanding the effect of risk factor trends on population based rates is to use models that incorporate an effect due to the risk factors.

METHODS: This community-based participatory cluster-randomized controlled intervention trial used a parallel two-group design. The sample consisted of 776 women aged 42 and older who had not had a mammogram in the preceding 2 years. The primary outcome was self-reported mammogram use between pretest and posttest. RESULTS: Overall, there was no statistically significant intervention effect, although the odds of self-reported mammogram use were higher in the intervention than the control group (odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.74, 2.14; P = 0.39). Exploratory subgroup analyses found that the intervention was effective only among women who were aware of mammograms but had never previously obtained one (OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.03, 3.85; P = 0.04). Low need for social support and lack of endorsement of culture-specific beliefs about breast cancer were associated with mammogram use in this group. In women unaware of mammography at pretest, high perceived susceptibility to breast cancer and endorsement of culture-specific beliefs were associated with mammogram use. For women who had previously obtained a mammogram, lower self-efficacy was associated with mammogram use. Intervention compared with control group women had significantly higher levels of knowledge of risk factors and lower endorsement of culture-specific beliefs at posttest. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a multifaceted education intervention may improve mammogram usage for certain subgroups of Samoan women.}

Demands for regulation of workplace smoking are based on studies reporting increased risk in non-smoking women whose husbands smoke. Although denying smoking can artificially elevate risk estimates, and although many studies reporting an increase have been conducted in Asia, no previous study of smoking habit misclassification has been conducted there. In this study 400 married Japanese women answered questions on smoking and ETS exposure and supplied urine for cotinine analysis. Of 106 with a cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR) indicating current smoking ({\textgreater} 100 ng/mg), 22 reported never smoking. These misclassified smokers had a median CCR (1408 ng/mg) similar to the 78 self-reported current smokers (1483 ng/mg). Of current smokers, 89.7\% had a currently smoking husband, while this was true of 51.0\% of non-smokers. Among 264 confirmed non-smokers (with CCR {\textless} 100 ng/mg), CCR was non-significantly lower if the husband smoked (11.51 vs 17.98 ng/mg) and was unrelated to various indices of smoking by the husband. Japanese epidemiological studies using "marriage to a smoker" to index ETS exposure may therefore have compared groups with similar ETS exposure, suggesting that associations reported between lung cancer and this index in some of these studies may result from bias. While other biases, including confounding, may also be important, bias resulting from smoking misclassification combined with husband/wife smoking concordance is shown to be of major concern. The high misclassification rates in Japan, much higher than in Western populations, undermine conclusions from epidemiological studies conducted there.}

OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved of each screening strategy. RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of \$76 183 per QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8\% of the benefits of lifetime screening at a cost of \$70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap testing to age 65 years captures 86.6\% of the benefits achievable by continuing to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than Pap testing at a cost threshold of \$5 for an HPV test. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with HPV plus Pap tests every 2 years appears to save additional years of life at reasonable costs compared with Pap testing alone. Applying age limits to screening is a viable option to maintain benefits while reducing costs.}

Because AR coactivators enhance transactivation of AR, in this report we evaluated the relationship of a CAG/CAA repeat length polymorphism in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene (amplified in breast cancer gene 1, a steroid receptor coactivator and an AR coactivator) with prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in China. Genomic DNA from 189 prostate cancer patients and 301 healthy controls was used for the PCR-based assay. The AIB1/SRC-3 CAG/CAA repeat length ranged from 24 to 32, with the most common repeat length being 29. Homozygous 29/29 and heterozygous 28/29 were the most common genotypes, with 44 and 30\% of the controls harboring these genotypes, respectively. Relative to subjects homozygous for 29 CAG/CAA repeats (29/29 genotype), individuals with the {\textless}29/29 genotype had a nonsignificant 31\% increased risk [odds ratio (OR), 1.31; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-1.97], whereas those homozygous for the {\textless}29 allele had a significant 81\% excess risk (OR, 1.81; 95\% CI, 1.00-3.28). The combined effect of CAG repeat lengths in the AR and AIB1/SRC-3 genes was also evaluated. Relative to men with both the 29/29 genotype of the AIB1/SRC-3 gene and a long CAG repeat length ({\textgreater} or =23) in the AR gene, those with both the {\textless}29/{\textless}29 AIB1/SRC-3 genotype and a short CAG repeat length in the AR gene ({\textless}23) had a 2.8-fold risk (OR, 2.78; 95\% CI, 1.24-6.26). Together, our data indicate that the CAG/CAA repeat length in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene may be associated with prostate cancer risk in Chinese men and that the combination of CAG/CAA repeat lengths in both the AIB1/SRC-3 and AR genes may provide a useful marker for clinically significant prostate cancer. Expanded studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association and the combined effect of AIB1/SRC-3 and other hormone-related genes in prostate cancer etiology.}

Data on women who had at least one Pap test over two years (January 1998-December 1999) were obtained from the NSW Pap test Register. Each local government area (LGA) was allocated to categories of population proportions of NESB and Indigenous status, a rurality classification based on population density and remoteness, and to an SES quintile. The odds ratios (OR) of having a Pap test were estimated and confounding adjusted by multiple logistic regression analysis. Implied Pap test rates in urban NESB and in rural Indigenous women were estimated from the modelled estimates. The adjusted OR for a Pap test in large rural centres (1.14) was significantly higher than those for metropolitan or capital city residents (0.9 and 1.0 respectively). Adjusted OR for a Pap test in other rural centres (0.73) and other remote areas (0.64) were significantly lower than those for metropolitan or capital city residents. In urban populations the lowest OR were in areas with both low SES and high proportion of NESB. The lowest OR for Pap screening in rural populations occurred in the most remote areas with the highest proportion of Indigenous women. For urban NESB women the biennial Pap test rate was estimated as 50\%, and for rural Indigenous women 29\%, compared with the NSW average of 59\%.}

Data collected for a retrospective cohort study of 2048 HIV-infected patients were analysed to examine the incidence of cancer. Cases of cancer occurring in South East England from 1985-1995 were obtained from the Thames Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by comparison of the observed number of cases for each cancer type in HIV-infected non-Africans with the numbers expected, calculated from the age and sex specific registration rates for the South East England population using person-years of observation. The crude incidence rates of cancer were calculated for HIV-infected Africans. The incidence of non-AIDS defining cancers such as Hodgkin's disease (standardized incidence ratio 22; 95\% CI: 3-80) and anal cancer (standardized incidence ratio 125; 95\% CI: 3-697) were significantly increased for non-African males with HIV disease. Anal cancer was also significantly increased for non-African females (standardized incidence ratio 1667; 95\% CI: 43-9287). Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was the commonest cancer among HIV-infected Africans and males had an incidence which was nearly 3 times that of females. There is evidence to suggest that the risks for other non-AIDS defining cancers were significantly increased in persons with HIV disease which may have implications for HIV/AIDS surveillance},

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the ALTS trial to determine whether HPV DNA testing is a cost-effective alternative to immediate colposcopy or conservative management with up to three cytology examinations. METHODS: Data from the ALTS trial were used in conjunction with medical care costs in a short-term decision model. The model compared the incremental costs per case of CIN3+ detected as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the following management strategies for women with ASCUS: immediate colposcopy, HPV DNA testing, and conservative management with up to three cytology examinations. RESULTS: The least costly and least sensitive strategy was conservative management with one repeat cytology examination using a threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) for referral to colposcopy. Compared with this strategy, triage to colposcopy based on a positive HPV DNA test result had an ICER of 3517 dollars per case of CIN3+ detected. Immediate colposcopy and conservative management with up to three repeat cytology visits detected fewer cases of CIN3+ and were more costly than HPV DNA testing. Immediate colposcopy became cost-effective at 20,370 dollars compared with HPV DNA testing only if colposcopy and biopsy were assumed to be 100\% sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: HPV DNA testing is an economically viable strategy for triage of ASCUS cytology. The less than perfect sensitivity of colposcopy and biopsy needs to be accounted for in future clinical guidelines and policy analyses.}

Here we report our studies on a cohort of over 400 patients with HIV infection studied cross-sectionally and longitudinally to examine the relationship between markers of immune cell activation and disease progression. To examine disease progression, 340 patients with HIV infection but without AIDS were followed for a total of 574 patient years, during which 56 developed AIDS. In our first study, 157 patients in CDC groups II-IV were examined cross-sectionally for in vivo expression of the activation markers HLA-DR and CD25 on CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Levels of CD3+ HLA-DR+ T cells are high in HIV infection and show a significant negative correlation with CD4 counts (r = 0.52; p {\textless} 0.001). The appearance of HLA-DR+ CD3+ T cells is an early feature of asymptomatic HIV+ patients, with a greater proportion (82\%) showing abnormally high levels of these than abnormally low levels of CD4 (52\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Examining activation of the CD4 subset specifically is likely to be of greater interest, given that this cell is the viral target. Indeed, we found that in the cross-sectional study, levels of HLA-DR+ and CD25+ CD4 lymphocytes show a step-wise linear increase with increasing disease severity (significant test for linear trend; p {\textless} 0.001). In our previous studies, only declining CD4 count has shown such a significant linear trend. These data suggest that measuring activated CD4+ T cells in the periphery may be a powerful predictive tool. In our second study, we examined the expression of other markers acquired (CD45R0) and lost (CD45RA) following activation of naive T cells. Examining expression of these on CD4 and CD8 cells cross-sectionally in 71 HIV+ patients, we found abnormalities in percentage levels of CD45RA+ and CD45R0+ populations, none of which showed any relationship to disease severity. Intriguingly, however, we noted that the surface density of both CD45RA and CD45R0 molecules on CD4 and CD8 cells was markedly and significantly reduced at all stages of HIV infection (eg relative specific fluorescence reduced by up to 50\%; p {\textless} 0.001). This abnormality was confirmed in studies using antibodies to a common epitope on all CD45 isoforms (pan-CD45) and to the CD45RB isoform. Finally, returning to the question of immune cell markers of activation and disease progression, we have examined some of the best documented markers in our longitudinal study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The majority of subjects were relatives and friends of ABA employees, and nearly half the cohort were either born at Wittenoom or first went there as children under 10 years of age. As most residents were at Wittenoom when the mine and mill were in operation during the period 1943 to 1966, 82\% were first exposed to crocidolite 20 or more years ago. The proportion of other workers (i.e., not employed by ABA) and their families increased once the mining operations ceased. To date, 24 cases of mesothelioma have been reported in this cohort: 9 males and 15 females.

These reported estimates, commonly quoted in the popular press, have the potential to promote early detection efforts, to increase cancer awareness, and to serve as an aid in study planning. However, they can also be easily misunderstood and frightening to the general public. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have recently begun including in annual reports lifetime and age-conditional risk estimates of developing cancer. These risk estimates are based on incidence rates that reflect new cases of the cancer in a population free of the cancer. To compute these estimates involves a cancer prevalence adjustment that is computed cross-sectionally from current incidence and mortality data derived within a multiple decrement life table. This paper presents a detailed description of the methodology for deriving lifetime and age-conditional risk estimates of developing cancer. In addition, an extension is made which, using a triple decrement life table, adjusts for a surgical procedure that removes individuals from the risk of developing a given cancer. Two important results which provide insights into the basic methodology are included in the discussion. First, the lifetime risk estimate does not depend on the cancer prevalence adjustment, although this is not the case for age-conditional risk estimates. Second, the lifetime risk estimate is always smaller when it is corrected for a surgical procedure that takes people out of the risk pool to develop the cancer. The methodology is applied to corpus and uterus NOS cancers, with a correction made for hysterectomy prevalence. The interpretation and limitations of risk estimates are also discussed.}

We give several examples illustrating that the decision of whether a recorded variable is a confounder in a data-set must be decided on the basis of subject-matter knowledge and clinical judgement. There is no alternative to use of such judgement; statistical selection procedures based on significant tests, such as stepwise regression, can be particularly misleading.}

The analysis was further extended to women who were on HRT at randomization but discontinued it during the 12-month intervention period (n = 33 on tamoxifen and n = 35 on placebo) and to women who were not on HRT but started it during intervention (n = 36 in both arms of the study). Compared with small changes in the placebo group, tamoxifen was associated with changes in total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol of approximately -9\%, -19\% and +0.2\% in continuous HRT users compared with -9\%, -14\% and -0.8\% in never HRT users. Similarly, there was no interaction on platelet count. In contrast, the decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol levels induced by tamoxifen was blunted by two-thirds in women who started HRT while on tamoxifen (P = 0.051 for the interaction term). We conclude that the beneficial effects of tamoxifen on cardiovascular risk factors are unchanged in current HRT users, whereas they may be attenuated in women who start transdermal HRT while on tamoxifen. Whereas a trial of tamoxifen in women already on transdermal HRT is warranted, prescription of HRT during tamoxifen may attenuate its activity.}

Australian suicide data (1996-1998) were analysed in conjunction with area-based prevalences of mental disorder derived from the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (1997). Poisson regression models of suicide risk included age, quintile of area-based SES, urban-rural residence, and country of birth (COB), with males and females analysed separately. Analysis focussed on the association between suicide and prevalences of (ICD-10) affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and suicide attempts by SES group. Prevalences of other psychiatric symptomatology, substance use problems, health service utilisation, stressful life-events and personality were also investigated. Significant increasing gradients were evident from high to low SES groups for prevalences of affective disorders, anxiety disorders (females only), and substance use disorders (males only); sub-threshold drug and alcohol problems and depression; and suicide attempts and suicide (males only). Prevalences of mental disorder, other sub-threshold mental health items and suicide attempts were significantly associated with suicide, but in most cases associations were reduced in magnitude and became statistically non-significant after adjustment for COB, urban-rural residence, and SES. For male suicide the relative risk (RR) in the lowest SES group compared to the highest was 1.40 (95\% CI 1.29-1.52, p{\textless}0.001) for all ages, and 1.46 (95\% CI 1.27-1.67, p{\textless}0.001) for male youth (20-34 years). This relationship was not substantially modified in males when regression models included prevalences of affective disorders, and other selected mental health variables and demographic factors. From a population perspective, SES remained significantly associated with suicide after controlling for the prevalence of mental disorders and other psychiatric symptomatology. Mental conditions and previous suicidal behaviour may play an intermediary role between SES and suicide, but this study suggests that an independent relationship between suicide and SES also exists.}

To construct a database for clinical epidemiological prostate cancer research based on linkages between the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden, a population-based, nationwide quality database, and other nationwide registries. Material and methods. By use of the individually unique Swedish Personal Identity Number, the NPCR was linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Register, the Prescribed Drug Register, the National Patient Register and the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register, all held at the Centre for Epidemiology at the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Register of the Total Population, the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies and the Multi-Generation Register, held at Statistics Sweden, and to the Swedish Hernia Register. Results. Record linkages between the NPCR and the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Register and the Register of the Total Population generated a database, named PCBaSe Sweden, including 80 079 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006. Record linkage between PCBaSe Sweden and the Prescribed Drug Register generated 59 721 unique matches and linkage to the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register resulted in 11 459 matches. Conclusion. PCBaSe Sweden is a newly created and unique database with over 80 000 cases of prostate cancer with comprehensive data on inpatient and outpatient care, patterns of use of prescribed drugs and socioeconomic and familial factors. Many topics in clinical prostate cancer epidemiology can be investigated. using PCBaSe Sweden.}

	annote = {This study is a comprehensive analysis of the latest followup of the Colorado uranium miners cohort using the two-stage clonal expansion model with particular emphasis on effects related to age and exposure. The model provides a framework in which the hazard function for lung cancer mortality incorporates detailed information on exposure to radon and radon progeny from hard rock and uranium mining together with information on cigarette smoking. Even though the effect of smoking on lung cancer risk is explicitly modeled, a significant birth cohort effect is found which shows a linear increase in the baseline lung cancer risk with birth year of the miners in the cohort. The analysis based on the two-stage clonal expansion model suggests that exposure to radon affects both the rate of initiation of intermediate cells in the pathway to cancer and the rate of proliferation of intermediate cells. However, in contrast to the promotional effect of radon, which is highly significant, the effect of radon on the rate of initiation is found to be not significant. The model is also used to study the inverse dose-rate effect. This effect is evident for radon exposures typical for mines but is predicted to be attenuated, and for longer exposures even reversed, for the more protracted and lower radon exposures in homes. The model also predicts the drop in risk with time after exposure ceases. For residential exposures, lung cancer risks are compared with the estimates from the BEIR VI report. While the risk estimates are in agreement with those derived from residential studies, they are about two- to fourfold lower than those reported in the BEIR VI report.

International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), quality of life (QoL) index and maximum urinary flow-rate (Qmax) were determined every 4 weeks for 6 months; postvoiding volume, prostate volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were assessed after 3 and 6 months of therapy. RESULTS: Mepartricin was shown to determine a statistically significant improvement over placebo in I-PSS and QoL index from month 2 onwards, and a significant linear increase in Qmax over the study period. At month 6, the improvement in the mepartricin and placebo groups in I-PSS, QoL index, and Qmax was 6.3 (standard error (SE) 0.51) and 4.2 (SE 0.60) points (P = 0.003), 0.99 (SE 0.14) and 0.62 (SE 0.12) points (P = 0.036), and 2.7 (SE 0.46) and 1.2 (SE 0.46) ml/sec (P = 0.051), respectively. No significant differences were noted in postvoiding residual volume, prostate volume, or PSA. Mepartricin tolerability was good, showing no adverse events on sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Mepartricin proved to be an effective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, determining an improvement in symptoms, quality of life, and peak urinary flow.}

It has been claimed that asbestosis is a necessary prerequisite for the malignancy, but epidemiologic studies usually do not have enough statistical strength to prove that asbestos-exposed patients without asbestosis are without risk. Several recent studies do actually indicate that there is a risk for such patients. In addition, case-referent studies of patients with lung cancer show an attributable risk for asbestos of 6\% to 23\%, which is much higher than the actual occurrence of asbestosis among these patients. Thus there is an increasing body of evidence that, at low exposure levels, asbestos produces a slight increase in the relative risk of lung cancer even in the absence of asbestosis. Consequently, all exposure to asbestos must be minimized.}

The number of outlier data points with significant elevations or reductions in risk was close to that expected by chance. They were dispersed geographically, and occurred in a variety of cancer types. We conclude that, in general, most of the geographic variation in cancer risk can be associated with variation in known risk factors, and that there appear to be no broad regional effects remaining after adjustment for these factors. A few cancer sites provide limited evidence of regional effects that may warrant further investigation.}

The illness was of sudden onset, lasted from 3 to 14 days, and was associated with fevers, sweats, malaise, lethargy, anorexia, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, sore throat, diarrhoea, generalised lymphadenopathy, a macular erythematous truncal eruption, and thrombocytopenia. In 1 subject an incubation period of 6 days after presumed exposure to ARV was determined and in 3 subjects seroconversion took place 19, 32, and 56 days after onset. Comparison of T-cell subsets before and after the acute illness showed inversion of T4:T8 ratio in 8 subjects, due to increased numbers of circulating T8+ cells. These findings support the notion of an acute clinical, immunological, and serological response to infection with ARV which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mononucleosis-like syndromes in groups at high risk for the development of AIDS.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of surgery versus observation for men with localized prostate cancer detected by means of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not known.
METHODS: From November 1994 through January 2002, we randomly assigned 731 men with localized prostate cancer (mean age, 67 years; median PSA value, 7.8 ng per milliliter) to radical prostatectomy or observation and followed them through January 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 10.0 years, 171 of 364 men (47.0\%) assigned to radical prostatectomy died, as compared with 183 of 367 (49.9\%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.08; P=0.22; absolute risk reduction, 2.9 percentage points). Among men assigned to radical prostatectomy, 21 (5.8\%) died from prostate cancer or treatment, as compared with 31 men (8.4\%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 1.09; P=0.09; absolute risk reduction, 2.6 percentage points). The effect of treatment on all-cause and prostate-cancer mortality did not differ according to age, race, coexisting conditions, self-reported performance status, or histologic features of the tumor. Radical prostatectomy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality among men with a PSA value greater than 10 ng per milliliter (P=0.04 for interaction) and possibly among those with intermediate-risk or high-risk tumors (P=0.07 for interaction). Adverse events within 30 days after surgery occurred in 21.4\% of men, including one death.
CONCLUSIONS: Among men with localized prostate cancer detected during the early era of PSA testing, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality, as compared with observation, through at least 12 years of follow-up. Absolute differences were less than 3 percentage points. (Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program and others; PIVOT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00007644.).},

METHODS: Data were from the nationwide population-based Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe Sweden), which includes data from the National Prostate Cancer Register, the Swedish Cancer Register, the Register of the Total Population, the Multi-Generation Register, and the Census database. We investigated the relationship of tumor characteristics, time from diagnosis of the index patient (i.e., prostate cancer patients in the National Prostate Cancer Register for whom at least one brother and their father could be identified), calendar period, geographic factors, and socioeconomic status to standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for prostate cancer among 22 511 brothers of 13 975 index patients in PCBaSe Sweden. RESULTS: Brothers of index patients with prostate cancer were at increased risk for a diagnosis of prostate cancer (SIR = 3.1, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9 to 3.3). Risk was higher for T1c tumors (SIR = 3.4, 95\% CI = 3.2 to 3.8) than for metastatic tumors (SIR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.5 to 2.6), and risk of T1c tumors was especially high during the first year after the diagnosis of the index patient (SIR = 4.3, 95\% CI = 3.8 to 4.9), compared with the following years (SIR range = 2.8-3.3), and for brothers of index patients who had a higher socioeconomic status (SIR = 4.2, 95\% CI = 3.7 to 4.7), compared with brothers of index patients with lower socioeconomic status (SIR = 2.8, 95\% CI = 2.4 to 3.2).

DESIGN: Four primary HIV-infected patients were treated for 6 months with ZDV, 250 mg twice daily, in association with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor L-697,661 500 mg three times daily. Viraemia, proviral DNA, CD4 and CD8 cell counts were measured serially during 18 months. RESULTS: Viraemia decreased to undetectable levels ({\textless} 200 RNA copies/ml) in two patients. A third patient had a marked decrease followed by a rebound during therapy; viraemia levels did not vary markedly in the fourth patient. A rebound in viraemia levels was observed within 15 days of discontinuation of therapy in the three responding patients. Proviral levels evolved in parallel with viraemia but were always detectable in all patients. In the three patients with an initial decrease of viraemia, CD4 cell counts were within the normal range 2 months after initiation of therapy and did not markedly decrease after discontinuation of therapy. In the two patients with partial or no response of viraemia, mutations associated with low level of resistance to L-697,661 appeared during treatment. CONCLUSION: A marked decrease of viraemia can be achieved in some primary HIV-infected patients with combined therapy. Six months of treatment does not prevent a rebound of viraemia, which was observed within 15 days of interruption of therapy.}

Risk factors associated with small for gestational age after controlling for potential confounders included maternal smoking during pregnancy (Odds ratio (OR) 2.61, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.65, 4.15), primiparity (OR 2.96, 95\% CI 1.59, 5.48), lack of antenatal care in the first trimester (OR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.13, 2.98) and young age when mother left school (OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.01, 2.41). Use of marijuana in pregnancy significantly increased risk of small for gestational age at the 6\% level (OR = 1.86, 95\% CI 0.98, 3.52). The population attributable risk for maternal smoking was 31.1\% (95\% CI 18.2, 41.9). CONCLUSION. Maternal smoking was the most important modifiable risk factor in this dataset for small for gestational age.}

Overall incidences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were 0.8 and 1.4 cases/100 person-years of follow-up (PYF), decreasing from 1.8 (TB) and 3.5 cases/100 PYF (MAC) before September 1995 to 0.3 and 0.2 cases/100 PYF after March 1997. After adjustment for changes in CD4 cell count and use of antiretroviral treatment in Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of MAC decreased with increasing calendar time (hazard ratio per calendar year; HR = 0.58 [95\% confidence intervals: 0.45-0.74], whereas this was not the case for TB; 0.95 [0.74-1.22]). In conclusion, we documented marked decreases in the incidence of TB and to an even larger extent of MAC among HIV-infected patients from 1994 to 1999. The decrease in TB was associated with the introduction of HAART and changes in CD4 cell count. These factors could also explain some of the decrease in MAC over time, though there remained a significantly lower risk of MAC than expected},

DESIGN: Data used were from 172 individuals with an estimated measure of NK cell activity and 146 with an estimated measure of LAK cell activity. Patients had active HIV infection at the time of enrolment in the study and have been followed-up prospectively for a median of 3.0 years. METHODS: The lytic activity of NK cells and LAK cells, the CD4 T lymphocyte count, and the concentration of CD16/CD56 NK cells were measured at enrolment. HIV RNA in plasma was measured retrospectively. Survival analysis was performed considering three main endpoints: CD4 cell counts below 100 x 10(6) cells/l, clinical AIDS, and death. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis and after adjustment for age, CD4 T lymphocyte count and plasma HIV RNA at enrolment, low LAK cell activity was significantly associated with higher risk of progression to a CD4 T lymphocyte count {\textless} 100 x 10(6) cells/l (crude P = 0.001; adjusted P = 0.04) and to death (crude P = 0.0002; adjusted P = 0.02). Patients with low NK cell responsiveness to interferon-alpha tended to be at higher risk of death (crude P = 0.04; adjusted P = 0.13) whereas unstimulated NK cell activity and the concentration of NK cells were of no prognostic value for patients in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that low LAK cell activity and low NK cell responsiveness to interferon-alpha may be important in the pathogenesis of HIV infection},

Data were analyzed for 1034 settlements in Ukraine and Belarus, in which more than 10 measurements of the (131)I content in human thyroids had been performed in May/June 1986. Thyroid doses due to the Chernobyl accident were assessed for the birth years 1968-1985 and related to thyroid cancers that were surgically removed during the period 1990-2001. The central estimate for the linear coefficient of the EAR dose response was 2.66 (95\% CI: 2.19; 3.13) cases per 10(4) PY-Gy; for the quadratic coefficient, it was -0.145 (95\% CI: -0.171; -0.119) cases per 10(4) PY-Gy(2). The EAR was found to be higher for females than for males by a factor of 1.4. It decreased with age at exposure and increased with age attained. The central estimate for the linear coefficient of the ERR dose response was 18.9 (95\% CI: 11.1; 26.7) Gy(-1); for the quadratic coefficient, it was -1.03 (95\% CI: -1.46; -0.60) Gy(-2). The ERR was found to be smaller for females than for males by a factor of 3.8 and decreased strongly with age at exposure. Both EAR and ERR were higher in the Belarusian settlements than in the Ukrainian settlements. In contrast to ERR, EAR increases with time after exposure. At the end of the observation period, excess risk estimates were found to be close to those observed in a major pooled analysis of seven studies of childhood thyroid cancer after external exposures.}

METHODS: Between 1997 and 1999, a total of 11,970 men, aged 55-74 years, were included in the intervention arm of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) section Rotterdam. Control population consisted of 133,287 men, aged 55-74 years, between 1998 and 1999 in Northern Ireland (NI). Men were followed for Pca incidence, Pca metastasis and cause of death until 31st December 2006. RESULTS: Median age in both groups was 63 years at study entry (p=0.184). In Rotterdam 94.2\% of men and in NI 6\% of men underwent PSA testing. In Rotterdam, 1153 men (9.6\%) were diagnosed with Pca with median baseline PSA of 5.1 ng/ml. In NI, 3962 men (3.0\%, p{\textless}0.001) were diagnosed with Pca with median baseline PSA of 18.0 ng/ml (p{\textless}0.001). The relative risk of Pca metastasis during observation in the intervention population compared to control population was 0.47 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.63; p{\textless}0.001). The relative risk of Pca-specific mortality was also lower in the intervention population compared to the control population after a median follow-up of 8.5 years: 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.45-0.88; p=0.008); absolute mortality reduction was 1.8 deaths per 1000 men. CONCLUSIONS: A relative reduction in Pca metastasis of 53\% and Pca mortality of 37\% was observed in the intervention population after 8.5 years of observation. The impact of overdiagnosis, quality of life benefits and cost-effectiveness need to be assessed before population-based PSA screening can be recommended.},

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted in the rural town of Bafang. Following an advocacy campaign, 750 women were recruited. After a clinical examination, all women had a Pap smear with the Cervex Brush. Each sample had two preparations, conventional and liquid based. The conventional smears were interpreted in Bafang. Cytologically abnormal cases, those with clinical inflammation and/or macroscopic cervical lesions, had a colposcopic examination and directed biopsy. HSIL and colposcopically abnormal cases were treated with large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). The liquid-based preparations and histopathology were performed in Geneva and the results sent to Cameroon for patient follow-up. RESULTS: Mean age and parity of the women screened were 43.7 years and 7.8, respectively. The conventional smears showed 3.6\% cervical abnormalities: 2\% (15/740) ASCUS/LSIL and 1.6\% (12/740) HSIL. The liquid-based preparations showed 12.6\% (91/722) cervical abnormalities: 10.1\% (73/722) ASCUS/LSIL and 2.5\% (18/722) HSIL. Fifty percent of samples in both preparations showed evidence of inflammation. Histology was performed on 64 colposcopically directed punch biopsies and LLETZ specimens. The histologic diagnoses agreed with the cytologic findings in 60\% (14/23) of conventional smears and 85\% (12/14) of liquid-based preparations. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the unscreened rural population of Cameroon. The situation is complicated by a high rate of cervical infection. A population-based cytologic screening program for cervical cancer would not be feasible in rural Cameroon because of high cost, low quality and limited technical facilities. Rural Africa requires an algorithm using a simple, low-cost technique of mass screening and an improved cytology service only to triage selected patients.}

Trends in cancer incidence rates were examined, based on four time periods defined by the availability of specific anti-retroviral therapies. RESULTS: Linkage identified 206 cases of KS and 235 cases of NHL in 8108 people reported with HIV infection. There was an increasing trend in NHL incidence rates over the four time periods (P for trend, 0.012), but incidence for the period since the availability of the new therapies was significantly lower than that for the period immediately prior (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95\% confidence interval, 0.36-0.92). Incidence of KS had been decreasing prior to the new therapies and declined further since their widespread use (P for trend, 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Population-based incidence rates of AIDS related KS and NHL have decreased since the widespread use of potent anti-retroviral therapies in Australia. NHL incidence decreased less than KS, and NHL is now the most common AIDS-associated cancer in Australia},

Studies have shown that control varies with the dose of radiotherapy delivered to the tumour. Other factors, including the dose per fraction and the time over which the treatment schedule is delivered are also important. The varying biological effectiveness of a number of different dose fraction time schedules used in the management of laryngeal tumours of different stages are considered, the end points being tumour control and associated morbidity. Special attention has been given to the length of time over which the schedule is delivered. Of the schedules examined the results would suggest that a dose of 60 Gy given in 25 fractions over a period of 35 days is the best of the six schedules studied for T1, T2, T3 and T4 lesions with minimal associated morbidity. It is possible, however, that the poor results shown on the Kaplan-Meier curves for patients treated with the schedule of 60 Gy in 30 fractions over a period of 42 days could be due to geographical misses of the tumours as 56\% were treated without a beam directed shell. The poor result obtained when patients were treated with the schedule of 60 Gy given in 30 fractions over 49+ days may be due to tumour repopulation occurring during the rest period though the possibility of geographical misses may contribute to the poor tumour control results. Mathematical modelling using linear quadratic analysis suggests that the shorter the period of time over which the treatment is given the better chance of achieving tumour control irrespective of the stage of the disease. These models were developed for patients treated with a beam directed shell thus excluding those patients who are most likely to be at risk from a geographic miss of the tumour. Linear quadratic analysis of the treatment data suggests that the ratio alpha/beta for tumour cells is estimated in the region of 13 Gy. For T1 lesions the tumour doubling time is in the order of 6 days, with longer doubling times for the more advanced stages. The analysis provides some support for investigative use of accelerated treatment schedules. This analysis also shows the importance of using beam directed shells when treating small fields especially in the head and neck region.}

The relative efficiency also depends in a complicated manner on such other factors as the distribution of exposure and the strength of the exposure-confounder relationship. In the majority of situations examined, however, dependent samples were found to be somewhat more efficient than independent samples when confounding was present, while the reverse was true when confounding was absent. Results of small sample simulations do not differ importantly from the asymptotic results, except for pair-matching on a non-confounder, where the inefficiency of matching is greater in small samples.}

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of screening compared with standard care in eligible patients with colorectal cancer and their siblings and children. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: National colorectal cancer registry data, the Creighton International Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Registry, Medicare claims records, and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and their siblings and children. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime (varies depending on age at screening). PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Initial office-based screening to determine eligibility (based on personal and family cancer history), followed by tumor testing for microsatellite instability. Those with microsatellite instability were offered genetic testing for HNPCC. Siblings and children of patients with cancer and the HNPCC mutation were offered genetic testing, and those who were found to carry the mutation received lifelong colorectal cancer screening. MEASUREMENTS: Life-years gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When only the patients with cancer were considered, cost-effectiveness of screening was \$42 210 per life-year gained. When patients with cancer and their siblings and children were considered together, cost-effectiveness increased to \$7556 per life-year gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The model was most sensitive to the estimated survival gain from screening siblings and children, to the prevalence of HNPCC mutations among patients with newly diagnosed cancer, and to the discount rate. In probabilistic analysis, the 90\% CI for the cost-effectiveness of screening patients with cancer plus their relatives was \$4874 to \$21 576 per life-year gained. CONCLUSION: Screening patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer for HNPCC is cost-effective, especially if the benefits to their immediate relatives are considered.}

We observed a nonsignificant decrease in risk associated with each unit of decrease in CAG length [odds ratio (OR), 0.98; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.93-1.03). Men with CAG {\textless}22 had a relative risk of prostate cancer of 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.65-1.23) compared with men with CAG {\textgreater} or =22. There was no appreciable difference in the mean number of GGC repeats between cases and controls; the estimated change in the risk of prostate cancer associated with one fewer GGC repeat was 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.88-1.06). The risk in men at or below the mean number of GGC repeats (17) was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.57-1.12). In contrast to prior reports, men with both short CAG ({\textless}22) and short GGC ({\textless} or =17) repeats were not at increased risk of prostate cancer (OR, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.98), compared with men with {\textgreater} or =22 CAG repeats and {\textgreater}17 GGC repeats.

Long waiting times favor patients with a slowly progressive end-stage lung disease and make the current allocation system the subject of discussion. In an attempt to equalize the chances for transplantation for every patient, irrespective of diagnosis, we investigated the effect of diagnosis-dependent prioritization on the waiting list, using a simulation model. METHODS: For the main disease categories on the waiting list, the relative risks of dying while on the waiting list were calculated using empirical data from the Dutch LTx program gathered over a period of 10 years. In a microsimulation model of the Dutch LTx program based on data from the actual situation, patients with diagnoses associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death while on the waiting list were prioritized by multiplying the time on the waiting list by the relative risk. RESULTS: Relative risks of death on the waiting list were increased significantly in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Prioritization resulted in an increased chance of transplantation for the prioritized diagnoses and a decreased chance for the non-prioritized diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses after LTx was almost equal to the distribution of diagnoses on the waiting list. CONCLUSION: The simulated method of prioritization on the waiting list is a step forward to a more equitable allocation of donor lungs. Moreover, this method is clinically feasible, as long as the waiting list is updated frequently.}

This second instalment of a two-part review of data quality methods at the cancer registry, focuses on the principles and techniques available for estimating completeness, separating methods into those that are semi-quantitative -- in that they give an indication of the degree of completeness relative to other registries or over time, and more quantitative techniques -- those that provide a numerical evaluation of the extent to which all eligible cases have been registered.},

	abstract = {The observation that the age-specific incidence curve of many carcinomas is approximately linear on a double logarithmic plot has led to much speculation regarding the number and nature of the critical events involved in carcinogenesis. By a consideration of colorectal and pancreatic cancers in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry we show that the log-log model provides a poor description of the data, and that a much better description is provided by a multistage model that predicts two basic phases in the age-specific incidence curves, a first exponential phase until the age of approximately 60 followed by a linear phase after that age. These two phases in the incidence curve reflect two phases in the process of carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, the early-exponential phase reflects events between the formation (initiation) of premalignant clones in a tissue and the clinical detection of a malignant tumor, whereas the linear phase reflects events leading to initiated cells that give rise to premalignant lesions because of abrogated growth/differentiation control. This model is consistent with Knudson's idea that renewal tissue, such as the colon, is converted into growing tissue before malignant transformation. The linear phase of the age-specific incidence curve represents this conversion, which is the result of recessive inactivation of a gatekeeper gene, such as the APC gene in the colon and the CDKN2A gene in the pancreas.},

The apparent ad hoc nature of models belies the methodologic rigor that is applied to create the best models in cancer prevention and care. Models have progressed from simple decision trees to extremely complex microsimulation analyses, yet all are built using a logical process based on objective evaluation of the path between intervention and outcome. The best modelers take great care to justify both the structure and content of the model and then test their assumptions using a comprehensive process of sensitivity analysis and model validation. Like clinical trials, models sometimes produce results that are later found to be invalid as other data become available. When weighing the value of models in health care decision making, it is reasonable to consider the alternatives. In the absence of data, clinical policy decisions are often based on the recommendations of expert opinion panels or on poorly defined notions of the standard of care or medical necessity. Because such decision making rarely entails the rigorous process of data collection, synthesis, and testing that is the core of well-conducted modeling, it is usually not possible for external audiences to examine the assumptions and data that were used to derive the decisions. One of the modeler's most challenging tasks is to make the structure and content of the model transparent to the intended audience. The purpose of this article is to clarify the process of modeling, so that readers of models are more knowledgeable about their uses, strengths, and limitations.}

After allowing for the effect of smoking on lung cancer the relative risk due to asbestos was highest for those who had never smoked, lowest for current smokers, and intermediate for ex-smokers; the trend was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). There was no significant association between smoking and deaths due to mesothelioma. Data from several studies are reviewed, and although overall non-smokers have a relative risk of lung cancer due to asbestos that is 1.8 times that of smokers, there is some uncertainty on the accuracy of this figure because of possible biases and sampling variation. Overall the evidence is that mesothelioma risk is independent of smoking.}

Furthermore, we make suggestions for the best timing of this interim analysis. CONCLUSION: Multi-arm, multi-stage trials are an effective way of speeding up the therapy evaluation process.

The authors directly addressed this question for 111 HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs who had been followed for up to 12 years from seroconversion and for whom a median of 16 CD4 lymphocyte counts had been made. Thirty-eight patients had developed AIDS by January 1, 1992. As of August 1, 1985, the time from seroconversion to AIDS ranged from 3 weeks to almost 6 years. The risk of AIDS increased with time from seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.25 per year; p = 0.09). CD4 lymphocyte count was strongly related to time from seroconversion and also to the risk of AIDS (relative hazard = 3.25 per 100/mm3; p {\textless} 0.00005). In a bivariate Cox regression model, the relative hazard for time from seroconversion fell markedly towards unity (1.05; p = 0.7), while that for CD4 lymphocyte count remained unchanged. This suggests that time from seroconversion is a relevant factor in HIV-1 infection only insofar as it provides information as to the probable degree of loss of CD4 lymphocytes. If the number of these cells is known, time from seroconversion seems to be of little additional value in assessing the risk of AIDS. This finding has implications for the clinical assessment of individual patient prognosis, for the design of epidemiologic studies of HIV-1 infection, and for our understanding of how HIV-1 causes disease},

This model was developed within the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) consortium. METHOD: A Monte Carlo simulation is developed to generate the life history of individual breast cancer patients by using CISNET base case inputs that describe the secular trend in breast cancer risk, dissemination patterns for screening mammography and adjuvant treatment, and death from causes other than breast cancer. The model generates the patient's age, tumor size and stage at detection, mode of detection, age at death, and cause of death (breast cancer versus other) based in part on assumptions on the natural history of breast cancer. Outcomes from multiple birth cohorts are summarized in terms of breast cancer mortality rates by calendar year. RESULT: Predicted breast cancer mortality rates follow the general shape of U.S. breast cancer mortality rates from 1975 to 1995 but level off after 1995 as opposed to following an observed decline. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the impact adjuvant treatment may be underestimated given the lack of data on temporal variation in treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: We developed a simulation model that uses CISNET base case inputs and closely, but not exactly, reproduces U.S. breast cancer mortality rates. Screening mammography and adjuvant therapy are shown to have both contributed to a decline in U.S. breast cancer mortality.},

The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator performs more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB.}

However, traditional long-term survival statistics, which are derived by cohort-based types of analysis, essentially reflect the survival expectations of patients diagnosed many years ago. They are therefore often severely outdated at the time they become available. A couple of years ago, a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, has been introduced to derive more 'up-to-date' estimates of long-term survival rates. We give a comprehensive review of the new methodology, its statistical background, empirical evaluation, computational realisation and applications. We conclude that period analysis is a powerful tool to provide more 'up-to-date' cancer survival rates. More widespread use by cancer registries should help to increase the use of cancer survival statistics for patients, clinicians, and public health authorities.}

We investigate the statistical properties of the estimator and compare it to others employed in the literature, showing how certain methods for incorporating discounting can introduce bias. We demonstrate the utility of the estimator by applying it to estimation of the costs attributable to ovarian cancer, using data from a database linking Medicare claims with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Our analysis suggests that the average, present value of the 15-year costs attributable to ovarian cancer is \$21,285 for local-stage cases and \$32,126 for distant-state cases in 1990 dollars.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Most genomic data have ultra-high dimensions with more than 10,000 genes (probes). Regularization methods with L₁ and L(p) penalty have been extensively studied in survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data. However, when the sample size n {\textless}{\textless} m (the number of genes), directly identifying a small subset of genes from ultra-high (m {\textgreater} 10, 000) dimensional data is time-consuming and not computationally efficient. In current microarray analysis, what people really do is select a couple of thousands (or hundreds) of genes using univariate analysis or statistical tests, and then apply the LASSO-type penalty to further reduce the number of disease associated genes. This two-step procedure may introduce bias and inaccuracy and lead us to miss biologically important genes.


RESULTS

The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a linear regression model and a useful alternative to the Cox model for survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear kernel based AFT model and an efficient variable selection method with adaptive kernel ridge regression. Our proposed variable selection method is based on the kernel matrix and dual problem with a much smaller n x n matrix. It is very efficient when the number of unknown variables (genes) is much larger than the number of samples. Moreover, the primal variables are explicitly updated and the sparsity in the solution is exploited.


CONCLUSIONS

Our proposed methods can simultaneously identify survival associated prognostic factors and predict survival outcomes with ultra-high dimensional genomic data. We have demonstrated the performance of our methods with both simulation and real data. The proposed method performs superbly with limited computational studies.},

METHODS: The 2554 men and women were followed from the time of AIDS diagnosis as part of the multicentre AIDS in Europe study, which examined AIDS cases diagnosed at 52 centres in 17 European countries between 1979 and 1989. Incidence of AIDS-defining diseases and demographic variables were recorded for all patients and CD4 lymphocyte count at the time of AIDS diagnosis for approximately half the patients. RESULTS: Only toxoplasmosis and herpes simplex virus ulceration showed statistically significant differences in occurrence rate between women and men [relative risks (RR), 1.51 and 3.44; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.51 1.09-2.08 and 3.44 1.92-6.23, respectively] which remained after adjusting for imbalances in other variables. For both diseases, the additional absolute rate in women was approximately three per 100 person-years at risk. Survival after AIDS diagnosis was also similar between the two sexes (RR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.08).

Standardized collection of demographic characteristics and sexual contact history, results of tests for HIV RNA, HIV culture, and T-cell subsets. RESULTS: 41 of 46 patients (89\%) developed an acute retroviral syndrome. Primary HIV infection was infrequently diagnosed at the initial medical encounter, even in persons enrolled in routine HIV screening programs. Median numbers of sexual partners 6 months and 1 month before acquisition of HIV were three and one, respectively; 21 patients (46\%) reported having had only one partner in the month before seroconversion. Of the 12 patients who could identify the precise date of and activity leading to seroconversion, 4 reported having only oral-genital contact. CONCLUSIONS: Primary HIV infection causes a recognizable clinical syndrome that is often underdiagnosed, even in persons enrolled in a program of routine surveillance for HIV infection. Frequency of sexual contact and overall numbers of sexual partners in this group of homosexual men who acquired HIV were markedly lower than those seen a decade ago. Acquisition of HIV does occur, even in persons with relatively few sexual partners. Increased attention to oral-genital contact as a means of acquiring HIV appears to be warranted.}

DESIGN: Population based survival of cancer patients in Estonia was compared with that of Estonian immigrants to Sweden and that of all cancer patients in Sweden. The cancer sites studied were female breast and ovary, male lung and prostate, and male and female stomach and colon. SETTING: Data on incident cases of cancer were obtained from the population based Swedish and Estonian cancer registries. PARTICIPANTS: Data from Estonian patients in Sweden, Estonian patients in Estonia, and patients from the total Swedish population were included in the study. MAIN RESULTS: Differences in survival among the three populations, controlling for follow-up time and age at diagnosis, were observed in breast, colon, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The survival rates of Estonians living in Sweden and the total population of Sweden were better than that of the Estonians living in Estonia. For cancers of the breast and prostate, the excess mortality in the older age group (75 and above) was much greater in Estonia than in the other populations. CONCLUSIONS: Most differences in cancer survival between Estonian and Swedish populations studied could be attributed to a longer delay in diagnosis, and also to inferior treatment (including access to treatment) in Estonia compared with Sweden. Estonia's lag in socioeconomic development, particularly in its public health organisation and funding, is probably the main source of the differences observed.}

METHODS: Women who presented to the ED of a large, urban public hospital during the study period with nonurgent conditions were eligible for a Papanicolaou test (Pap smear) and a clinical breast examination (CBE) if they were 18 years of age or older and for a mammogram if they were 40 years of age or older, provided they had not had the screening examination within the past year. The Pap smear and CBE were performed by a nurse, and mammography was scheduled for a later date. Women with gynecologic complaints were excluded. RESULTS: On the basis of screening history, medical status, and age, 1,850 (32\%) of the 5,830 women seen in the ER during the 23-month study period were eligible for both mammography and CBE, and 2,361 (41\%) were eligible for Pap smears. Of these women, 116 (6\%) completed mammography and CBE, and 644 (27\%) received Pap smears. Among screened women, 10 (9\%) and 20 (3\%), respectively, had results that were suspicious or positive for breast or cervical cancer. Follow-up rates were low: 20\% for breast screening and 50\% for Pap smears. Among those receiving follow-up, 1 woman was found to have breast cancer and 8 were found to have cervical neoplasia. CONCLUSION: ED cancer screening was feasible and yielded a high rate of cancer detection. Program efficiency was hampered by low volume and high numbers of patients lost to follow-up after abnormal screening results. Greater integration into the acute care setting and more intensive recruitment and follow-up strategies are needed to maximize the potential yield and cost effectiveness of such programs.}

	annote = {In this paper we discuss a number of issues that are pertinent to the analysis of disease mapping data. As an illustrative example we consider the mapping of larynx cancer across electoral wards in the North West Thames region of the U.K. Bayesian hierarchical models are now frequently employed to carry out such mapping. In a typical situation, a three-stage hierarchical model is specified in which the data are modelled as a function of area-specific relative risks at stage one; the collection of relative risks across the study region are modelled at stage two; and at stage three prior distributions are assigned to parameters of the stage two distribution. Such models allow area-specific disease relative risks to be 'smoothed' towards global and/or local mean levels across the study region. However, these models contain many structural and functional assumptions at different levels of the hierarchy; we aim to discuss some of these assumptions and illustrate their sensitivity. When relative risks are the endpoint of interest, it is common practice to assume that, for each of the age-sex strata of a particular area, there is a common multiplier (the relative risk) acting upon each of the stratum-specific risks in that area; we will examine this proportionality assumption. We also consider the choices of models and priors at stages two and three of the hierarchy, the effect of outlying areas, and an assessment of the level of smoothing that is being carried out. For inference, we concentrate on the description of the spatial variability in relative risks and on the association between the relative risks of larynx cancer and an area-level measure of socio-economic status.}

We aimed to test this hypothesis using previously unpublished data from eight European, Canadian, and US case-control studies of the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph). METHODS: We selected 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for analysis, on the basis of previous functional or association data, in nine genes that have important roles in lymphoid development, Th1/Th2 balance, and proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory pathways (IL1A, IL1RN, IL1B, IL2, IL6, IL10, TNF, LTA, and CARD15). Genotype data for one or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms were available for 3586 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and for 4018 controls, and were assessed in a pooled analysis by use of a random-effects logistic regression model. FINDINGS: The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -308G--{\textgreater}A polymorphism was associated with increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p for trend=0.005), particularly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the main histological subtype (odds ratio 1.29 [95\% CI 1.10-1.51] for GA and 1.65 [1.16-2.34] for AA, p for trend {\textless}0.0001), but not for follicular lymphoma. The interleukin 10 (IL10) -3575T--{\textgreater}A polymorphism was also associated with increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p for trend=0.02), again particularly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (p for trend=0.006). For individuals homozygous for the TNF -308A allele and carrying at least one IL10 -3575A allele, risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma doubled (2.13 [1.37-3.32], p=0.00083). INTERPRETATION: Common polymorphisms in TNF and IL10, key cytokines for the inflammatory response and Th1/Th2 balance, could be susceptibility loci for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of consortia for investigating the genetic basis of chronic diseases like cancer.}

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of primary care, health insurance, and HMO participation on adherence to regular breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN: Random-digit-dial and targeted household telephone survey of a population-based sample. SETTING: Washington, D.C. census tracts with {\textgreater} or =30\% of households below 200\% of federal poverty threshold. PARTICIPANTS: Included in the survey were 1,205 women over age 40, 82\% of whom were African American. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was defined as reported receipt of the last 2 screening tests within recommended intervals for age. RESULTS: The survey completion rate was 85\%. Overall, 75\% of respondents were adherent to regular Pap smears, 66\% to clinical breast exams, 65\% to mammography, and 29\% to fecal occult blood test recommendations. Continuity with a single primary care practitioner, comprehensive service delivery, and higher patient satisfaction with the relationships with primary care practitioners were associated with higher adherence across the 4 screening tests, after considering other factors. Coordination of care also was associated with screening adherence for women age 65 and over, but not for the younger women. Compared with counterparts in non-HMO plans, women enrolled in health maintenance organizations were also more likely to be adherent to regular screening (e.g., Pap, odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 3.17; clinical breast exam, OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.21 to 3.44; mammogram, OR 1.95, 95\% CI 1.15 to 3.31; fecal occult blood test, OR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.83.) CONCLUSIONS: Organizing healthcare services to promote continuity with a specific primary care clinician, a comprehensive array of services available at the primary care delivery site, coordination among providers, and better patient-practitioner relationships are likely to improve inner-city, low-income women's adherence to cancer screening recommendations.}

First use of a protease inhibitor might offer the most realistic chance of achieving this aim. Our objective was to study the virological response to protease inhibitors in patients taking them for the first time. METHODS: A total of 901 patients from a large outpatient clinic were followed a mean of 15 months from the time of starting a protease inhibitor until 1 May 1998. Viral load and CD4 cell count measurements were made on average every 34 days. RESULTS: Overall there was a 79\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 76-82] probability of the patients achieving a viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml by 24 weeks after starting the protease inhibitor. In a multiple Cox regression model, those with lower initial viral load [relative hazard (RH), 0.72; P {\textless} 0.0001], higher CD4 cell count (RH, 1.07; P = 0.002), those starting other new drugs at same time as the protease inhibitor (RH, 1.46 for two versus none; P = 0.003), those who were antiretroviral-naive, and those using indinavir or nelfinavir were more likely to achieve such levels. In those 651 patients achieving viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml within 24 weeks, there was an estimated 53\% (95\% CI, 51-55) probability of rebound of viral load to {\textgreater} 500 copies/ml by 52 weeks from the first undetectable value. Again, those who had started other new drugs at the same time as the protease inhibitor (RH, 0.57; P = 0.003 for starting two versus none) tended to experience a lower probability of viral load rebound, as did those with higher initial CD4 cell count (RH, 0.87 per 100 x 10(6)/l higher; P = 0.0007). Those who took saquinavir achieved less durable virological responses than those who took other protease inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Starting protease inhibitor therapy with two other new antiretroviral drugs simultaneously with protease inhibitor therapy offers a better best chance of achieving sustained viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml than starting fewer new drugs},

In women, rates rose about sevenfold in the United States but only about threefold in the United Kingdom. To investigate whether these very different trends in lung cancer risk could be explained by smoking habits, trends in smoking were compared in the two countries and a multistage model was used to predict lung cancer rates from detailed data on age of starting and stopping smoking, amount smoked per smoker, and sales-weighted average tar levels. In both countries, there was a similar switch to filter cigarettes, reduction in tar levels and the average age of starting to smoke, and decline in prevalence of smoking in women aged under 50 yr and in men. Although some differences were evident, most notably in older women where prevalence of smoking and consumption per adult has increased more in the United States, these trends do not appear to explain the markedly different trends in lung cancer, evident in both sexes and all age groups. The multistage analyses confirmed these tentative conclusions-the differing trends in smoking in the two countries could not explain the markedly differing trends in lung cancer. Lung cancer trends in the United Kingdom were found to be clearly more favorable than expected on the basis of smoking trends, while trends in the United States were less favorable. In sensitivity analyses, these conclusions were found not to be materially dependent on the precise methods used, including whether tar reduction was or was not assumed to be beneficial. The explanation for these findings must lie in changes over time, differing in the two countries, in aspects of smoking not considered in these analyses and/or in exposure to other risk factors. Evidence relating to a number of possible such smoking variables (including type of tobacco, curing, use of pesticides and additives, and butt length) or other risk factors (including air pollution, radon, asbestos, obesity, and marijuana) is discussed, but no clear explanation of the findings is offered. Further research is urgently needed to investigate the causes of these apparently anomalous trends in lung cancer and in smoking habits. Criticism is also presented of the views recently expressed by the authors of NCI Monograph 13 that tar reduction has been ineffective in lowering lung cancer risk and that trends in lung cancer in the United States fit in well with trends in smoking habits.}

METHODS: Admission, pre-autopsy and post-autopsy diagnoses were recorded for 1000 consecutive autopsies in each of two University departments in Budapest with high autopsy rates for persons dying in hospital. In those 87 cases where one or more diagnosis included primary lung cancer, additional data were collected concerning clinical investigations relevant to the diagnosis and the histological type lung cancer, and on smoking habits. RESULTS: 59\% (36/61) of lung cancers seen at autopsy were not detected pre-autopsy, while 50\% (25/50) of those diagnosed pre-autopsy were not confirmed at autopsy. Many misdiagnoses arose because patients were too ill to be properly investigated and/or died before investigations could be completed. Accuracy of diagnosis increased with the number of diagnostic techniques applied, but was still far from perfect in the absence of necropsy. Underdiagnosis was commoner in non-smokers and overdiagnosis commoner in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Without necropsy, lung cancer misdiagnosis is common, especially when modern diagnostic procedures cannot be fully employed. Knowledge of smoking habits may affect diagnostic accuracy.}

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Progression to severe CD4 lymphocytopenia (CD4 lymphocyte count {\textless} 200 x 10(6)/l), development of AIDS defining diseases, and death from AIDS. RESULTS--Thirty two women and 67 men developed AIDS at Kaplan-Meier progression rates of 25\% (95\% confidence interval 13.8\% to 35.5\%) and 23\% (15.6\% to 30.4\%), respectively, 7 years after seroconversion. In a Cox proportional hazards model the relative hazard was 0.93 (that is, a slightly lower hazard in women) before and 1.10 (0.70 to 1.72) after adjusting for age, HIV exposure group, and year of seroconversion. When CD4 lymphocytopenia and death from AIDS were used as end points the results were similar, with adjusted relative hazards of 0.95 (0.63 to 1.42) and 0.72 (0.48 to 1.79) respectively. In both women and men the risk of developing AIDS before the CD4 lymphocyte count had declined below 200 x 10(6)/l was small (3\% in women, 6\% in men). The estimated median count at which AIDS developed in women (34 x 10(6)/l; 10 x 10(6) to 44 x 10(6)) was similar to that for men (44 x 10(6)/l; 22 x 10(6) to 60 x 10(6)).

Data collected from participants included sociodemographic attributes, physical health, psychological measures and work stressors relating to job control, job demands, job security and skills discretion at work. For 88\% of these participants, information on visits made to general practitioners (GPs) for the six months before and after their survey interview was obtained from health insurance records.Results: When work stress and personal factors were taken into account, men at more junior levels reported better mental health, more positive affect and used fewer GP services. Women at middle-management levels obtained less GP care than their more senior counterparts. Both men and women who reported higher levels of work stress were found to have poorer mental health and well-being. The impact of such stressors on GP service use, however, differed for men and women.Conclusion: Measures of work stress and not employee level affect the mental health and wellbeing of government employees. For governments with responsibility for funding health care services, reducing work stress experienced by their own employees offers potential benefits by improving the health of their workforce and reducing outlays for such services.}

The optimal method for monitoring the progress of patient care across the full spectrum of provider settings is through the population-based study of cancer patient survival, which is only possible using data collected by population-based cancer registries. The probability of cure, "statistical cure", is defined for a cohort of cancer patients as the percent of patients whose annual death rate equals the death rate of general cancer-free population. Mixture cure models have been widely used to model failure time data. The models provide simultaneous estimates of the proportion of the patients cured from cancer and the distribution of the failure times for the uncured patients (latency distribution). CANSURV (CAN-cer SURVival) is a Windows software fitting both the standard survival models and the cure models to population-based cancer survival data. CANSURV can analyze both cause-specific survival data and, especially, relative survival data, which is the standard measure of net survival in population-based cancer studies. It can also fit parametric (cure) survival models to the individual data. The program is available at . The colorectal cancer survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program [Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, The Portable Survival System/Mainframe Survival System, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, 1999.] of the National Cancer Institute, NIH is used to demonstrate the use of CANSURV program.},

Health measures were depression. physical health. self-rated health, and general practitioner visits.Employees were classified according to their job quality (strain. perceived job insecurity and marketability). Employee health was compared to people who were unemployed,. and to people who were not in the labour force.We found that unemployed people reported worse health when compared to all employees. However. distinguishing ill terms of employee's job quality revealed a more complex pattern. Poor quality jobs (characterized by insecurity, low marketability and job strain) were associated with worse health when compared to jobs with fewer or no stressors. Furthermore, people in jobs with three or more of the psychosocial stressors report health that is no better than the unemployed.In conclusion, paid work confers health benefits. but poor quality jobs which combine several psychosocial stressors could be as bad for health as being unemployed. Thus. workplace and industrial relations policies that diminish worker autonomy and security may generate short-term economic gains. but place longer-term burdens on the health of employees and the health-care system.

DESIGN--A comparison of AIDS defining conditions and CD4 counts in HIV positive and HIV negative patients with haemophilia matched for usage of clotting factor concentrate. SETTING--A comprehensive care haemophilia centre. SUBJECTS--17 HIV positive and 17 HIV negative male patients with haemophilia A (age range 12-60 at beginning of study period) who had received similar amounts of clotting factor concentrate yearly over the years 1980-90. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Clinical events listed as AIDS defining in the Centers for Disease Control AIDS definition; CD4 lymphocyte counts; death. RESULTS--Of 108 HIV positive male patients with haemophilia A, only 17 could be matched to an HIV negative patient. This was due to the much higher average usage of factor VIII in the HIV positive group. Between 1980 and 1990, 16 clinical events occurred in nine of the 17 HIV positive patients. No event occurred in the 17 HIV negative patients. In each pair the mean CD4 count during follow up was, on average, 0.5 x 10(9)/l lower in the HIV positive patient.

Individuals were randomized to receive stavudine (d4T), SQV, and one of ritonavir, nelfinavir, or delavirdine to enhance SQV blood levels. METHOD: The protease and reverse transcriptase baseline sequences of 31 treatment- experienced patients were analyzed by genotype and virtual phenotype and were related to viral load at weeks 12 and 24. Genotypic resistance to SQV was defined by the presence of G48V and/or L90M mutations in the protease gene. Potential cross-resistance to d4T in zidovudine (ZDV)- experienced individuals was defined by the presence of thymidine- associated mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene. RESULTS: ZDV- associated mutations did not affect the virological response at 24 weeks. Individuals who were sensitive to SQV at baseline as determined by either genotyping or virtual phenotyping showed a greater decrease in viral load at week 24 than those resistant to SQV, irrespective of treatment arm. By genotyping, SQV-sensitive individuals had a median log decrease of 1.12 compared to 0.32 for those individuals who were SQV resistant. By virtual phenotyping, SQV-sensitive individuals had a median log decrease of 1.0 compared to a rise of 0.08 in resistant individuals. CONCLUSION: Thymidine analogue-associated mutations at baseline did not influence the response to subsequent therapy involving d4T. Individuals who were sensitive or resistant to SQV by genotyping or virtual phenotyping responded to SQV-enhancing regimens, but the virological response was greater in those who were sensitive},

Since the introduction of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test tumors are diagnosed with a favorable tumor stage and differentiation grade. Does screening with PSA just detect more tumors with favorable characteristics or is dedifferentiation actually being prevented by early detection and consequent treatment? The latter option implies that tumors dedifferentiate in the preclinical screen-detectable phase. To model the natural history of prostate cancer, we analyzed the age-specific distribution of clinical stage and Gleason score of 2,204 tumors diagnosed in the ERSPC-Rotterdam trial. We fitted 2 MISCAN simulation models to the observed data: Model I where tumors dedifferentiate before becoming screen-detectable and Model II where dedifferentiation occurs during the screen-detectable preclinical phase. The hypothesis of dedifferentiation during the screen-detectable phase was tested by a goodness of fit test of both models. In ERSPC-Rotterdam, we observed a significantly more favorable distribution of Gleason scores in screen-detected cancers compared to cancers found in the control arm, and in cancers detected in the second round compared to cancers detected in the first round of screening. Also, a significant association between Gleason score and age at diagnosis was found, most notably in cancers detected in the first round of screening. These findings were reproduced by Model II and less so by Model I, with a significant difference in goodness of fit between the 2 models (p {\textless} 0.001). This study provides epidemiological evidence of dedifferentiation as a major mechanism of progression in prostate cancer. Tumors dedifferentiate during the screen-detectable phase and consequently screening with PSA and early treatment can possibly prevent dedifferentiation.}

METHODS: The incidence of mesothelioma was modelled in two ways. First by using an age/birth cohort model, and second by using a model based on potential exposure to asbestos in terms of age and calendar year. The latter model included a term for clearance of asbestos fibres from the lungs, and a term for diagnostic fraction. The age and calendar year model was based on the model introduced by Hodgson and colleagues but replaced piecewise effects by smooth functions represented by cubic splines. RESULTS: The number of mesotheliomas between 2004 and 2060 was predicted as 6690 with the age-cohort model and as 6779 by the age and calendar year model, with peak annual numbers of 187 in the year 2021 and 196 in the year 2014 with the two models respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of parameter estimates in the two models was in accord with the known use of amphibole asbestos in Australia. The predicted peak year of 2014-21 is 30-35 years after the phasing out of amphibole use, and this period is in accord with predictions for the UK and the US; in the latter country the peak was 10-15 years earlier corresponding to a marked decline of amphibole use in and following the 1960s.}

From each community, random samples of 352 women between 50 and 80 years old participated by completing a telephone survey that included questions on a variety of topics, including their use of mammography. Logistic regression analyses revealed community of residence to be a significant predictor of individual women's mammography use after adjusting for individual level predictors of mammography use including age, education, employment, marital status, financial situation, and ease of access to medical services. An examination of the influence of community characteristics revealed women living in communities with supportive community attitudes towards mammography use report higher levels of mammography use than do women living in communities with less supportive attitudes. The presence or absence of male or female physicians or of mammography facilities in a local community was not associated with statistically significant effects on women's mammography use. Community attitudes are associated with mammography use in rural communities. Public health interventions that change community attitudes may have effects that extend beyond the people directly contacted by these interventions.}

The exploration of these data, together with an analysis of lung cancer mortality by age-period-cohort models shows that the increase of smoking and lung cancer is modulated by factors related to the country-specific socio-economic environment and that it proceeds in waves. Though recent data indicate a decline in the prevalence of smoking among both sexes, Germany is now on the way to having a similar smoking-related cancer mortality to those countries in the world which previously had a much higher rate, but have intervened vigorously. The refusal in Germany to adopt actions such as those successfully implemented to save lives in these countries means that the German population is exposed to avoidable risks, whose effects can be counted in the terms of the thousands of lives that might have been saved each year.}

Th and CTL responses to HIV-1 were detected within 2 weeks following HIV-1 infection, and CTL responses to HIV-1 antigens peaked at 4 weeks after infection ({\textgreater}100 HIV-specific CTL/10[6] PBMC), coincident with reductions of HIV-1 RNA and DNA levels in peripheral blood.

Thus, T cell responses temporally correlate with control of HIV-1 in macaques. The induction of a brisk HIV-1-specific CTL response may have been facilitated by a persistent Th response.}

Special attention is given to the need for randomization to justify causal inferences from conventional statistics, and the need for random sampling to justify descriptive inferences. In most epidemiologic studies, randomization and random sampling play little or no role in the assembly of study cohorts. I therefore conclude that probabilistic interpretations of conventional statistics are rarely justified, and that such interpretations may encourage misinterpretation of nonrandomized studies. Possible remedies for this problem include deemphasizing inferential statistics in favor of data descriptors, and adopting statistical techniques based on more realistic probability models than those in common use.}

	abstract = {Advances in technology provide new diagnostic tests for early detection of disease. Frequently, these tests have continuous outcomes. One popular method to summarize the accuracy of such a test is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Methods for estimating ROC curves have long been available. To examine covariate effects, Pepe (1997, 2000) and Alonzo and Pepe (2002) proposed distribution-free approaches based on a parametric regression model for the ROC curve. Cai and Pepe (2002) extended the parametric ROC regression model by allowing an arbitrary non-parametric baseline function. In this paper, while we follow the same semi-parametric setting as in that paper, we highlight a new estimator that offers several improvements over the earlier work: superior efficiency, the ability to estimate the covariate effects without estimating the non-parametric baseline function and easy implementation with standard software. The methodology is applied to a case control dataset where we evaluate the accuracy of the prostate-specific antigen as a biomarker for early detection of prostate cancer. Simulation studies suggest that the new estimator under the semi-parametric model, while always being more robust, has efficiency that is comparable to or better than the Alonzo and Pepe (2002) estimator from the parametric model.},

METHODS: We aimed to provide such information for men aged 40, 50, 60, and 70 years at low, moderate, and high risk for prostate cancer. A Markov model compared patients with vs without annual PSA screening using a 20\% relative risk (RR) reduction (RR = 0.8) in prostate cancer mortality as a best-case scenario. The model estimated numbers of biopsies, prostate cancers, and deaths from prostate cancer per 1000 men over 10 years and cumulated to age 85 years. RESULTS: Benefits and harms vary substantially with age and familial risk. Using 60-year-old men with low risk as an example, of 1000 men screened annually, we estimate that 115 men will undergo biopsy triggered by an abnormal PSA screen result and that 53 men will be diagnosed as having prostate cancer over 10 years compared with 23 men diagnosed as having prostate cancer among 1000 unscreened men. Among screened men, 3.5 will die of prostate cancer over 10 years compared with 4.4 deaths in unscreened men. For 1000 men screened from 40 to 69 years of age, there will be 27.9 prostate cancer deaths and 639.5 deaths overall by age 85 years compared with 29.9 prostate cancer deaths and 640.4 deaths overall in unscreened men. Higher-risk men have more prostate cancer deaths averted but also more prostate cancers diagnosed and related harms. CONCLUSIONS: Men should be informed of the likely benefits and harms of PSA screening. These estimates can be used to support individual decision making.},

There is a need for methods that can accommodate more complex observation schemes involving general censoring and truncation. In addition, it is important in many epidemiological applications to have a smooth estimate of the hazard function. We show that the penalized likelihood approach gives a solution to these problems. The solution of the maximum of the penalized likelihood is approximated on a basis of splines. The smoothing parameter is estimated using approximate cross-validation; confidence bands can be given. A simulation study shows that this approach gives better results than the smoothed Nelson-Aalen estimator. We apply this method to the analysis of data from a large cohort study on cerebral aging.

METHODS: Zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir and amprenavir were initiated during PHI as part of the Quest study. Absolute numbers of CD8+/CD38++ T cells were determined using three-colour flow cytometry, and plasma viral load (VL) was measured using the Roche Amplicor method. RESULTS: The median, pre-therapy CD8+/CD38++ T cell count was 461/mm3 (interquartile range 216, 974) in 131 patients compared with normal control values of less than 20 cells/mm3. Levels fell markedly in parallel with VL within the first 2 weeks of HAART initiation, to a median of 47 cells/mm3at 28 weeks (median 436 cell decline; P {\textless} 0.001). At that time, 80\% of patients had a VL less than 50 copies/ml, and 16.3\% of all patients had less than 20 CD8+/CD38++ T cells/mm3. A continued decrease in CD8+/CD38++ T cell count occurred in 67.2\% of patients whose VL was maintained below 50 copies/ml (median change from first to last value minus sign18 cells/mm3; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: After the initiation of HAART in PHI, CD8+/CD38++ lymphocytes declined rapidly in parallel with VL, and allowed for a normalization of CD8+/CD38++ T cell numbers in a subset of patients at week 28. Cell numbers continued to decline in patients who maintained VL below 50 copies/ml, indicating that the CD8+/CD38++ T cell count may represent a marker of residual viral replication when VL falls below detectable levels after HAART intervention.}

The observed mean surveillance cost was 713. If French recommendations were strictly applied, the estimated mean cost would vary between 680 and 1,069 according to the frequency of abdominal ultrasound. The predicted determinants of cost were: age, recurrence, duration of surveillance since diagnosis, and adjuvant treatments. For France, the surveillance cost represented 4.4\% of the cost of colorectal cancer management. The cost of surveillance should now be balanced with its effectiveness and compared with surveillance alternatives.}

DESIGN: Inter-method reliability study. SETTING: A randomised trial in subjects with past asbestos exposure. SUBJECTS: Seventy-two adults living in Western Australia. METHODS: A semi-quantitative FFQ developed by the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation in South Australia was administered after the completion of four 7-day diet records (DRs). RESULTS: Mean agreement between methods was not significantly different from 100\% for many nutrients, but the limits of agreement indicated that, at the individual level, the FFQ over- or underestimated the DR by at least 50\%. Mean agreement between methods decreased significantly with increasing intakes for the majority of nutrients. Pearson's correlation coefficients were less informative indicators of agreement compared with the limits of agreement. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate poor agreement between the FFQ and DR when estimating absolute intakes. Therefore, comparing intakes collected using this FFQ with specific cut-off points such as Recommended Dietary Intakes for nutrition surveillance may lead to seriously flawed conclusions about population intakes.}

They demonstrate that the proposed guideline was known to be inadequate when it was first proposed, was severely criticized between 1946 and 1968, but nonetheless was promulgated annually and remained unchanged 1971.}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A person-years analysis was used to determine the incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses according to calendar year and stratification by CD4 lymphocyte count and treatment regimen in 1806 patients from the Royal Free Centre for HIV Medicine with at least one CD4 lymphocyte count and follow-up visit. RESULTS: Prior to 1992, the incidence of all AIDS-defining illnesses was 27.4/100 person-years of follow-up (PYFU; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 22.8-32.0) and during 1997 this incidence had dropped to 6.9/100 PYFU (95\% CI, 4.7-9.1; p {\textless} .0001, test for trend). The decline in incidence over time occurred in esophageal candidiasis, cytomegalovirus disease (including retinitis), Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, wasting syndrome, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (p {\textless} .05, test for trend), but there was no evidence of a decline in AIDS dementia or in Mycobacterium avium complex. In 1997, among patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts of {\textless} or =200 cells/mm3, the incidence rates for any AIDS-defining illness was 51.1/100 PYFU for patients taking no therapy (95\% CI, 27.9-85.7), 34.5 among patients on monotherapy (95\% CI, 4.2-124.6), 13.2 among patients taking dual combination therapy (95\% CI, 3.6-33.8) and 6.1 among patients taking triple therapy or more complex regimens (95\% CI, 0.7-22.0; p {\textless} .0001, test for trend). CONCLUSIONS: There was a considerable decline in AIDS-defining illnesses during 1996 and 1997, coinciding with the rapid development of new antiretroviral treatments and combinations of treatment. Further follow-up of large observational cohorts is essential to monitor the incidence of diagnoses less common than we were able to consider, such as tuberculosis, cryptosporidiosis, and cryptococcosis, and also to investigate whether the incidence of disease continues to fall, or whether it starts to rise again, as toxicities, compliance, drug resistance, and long-term side effects begin to appear},

We assessed whether prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be safely discontinued after HAART is started. METHODS: We investigated 7333 HIV-1-infected patients already enrolled in EuroSIDA, a continuing prospective observational cohort study in 52 centres across Europe and Israel. We did a person-years analysis of the rate of discontinuation of PCP prophylaxis and of the incidence of PCP after the introduction of HAART into clinical practice from July, 1996. FINDINGS: The rate of discontinuation of primary and secondary PCP prophylaxis increased up to 21.9 discontinuations per 100 person-years of follow-up after March, 1998. 378 patients discontinued primary (319) or secondary (59) prophylaxis a median of 10 months after starting HAART. At discontinuation for primary and secondary prophylaxis, respectively, the median CD4-lymphocyte counts were 274 cells/microL and 270 cells/microL, the median plasma HIV-1 RNA load 500 copies/mL, and the median lowest recorded CD4-lymphocyte counts 123 cells/microL and 60 cells/microL. During 247 person-years of follow-up, no patient developed PCP (incidence density 0 [95\% CI 0-1.5]). INTERPRETATION: The risk of PCP after stopping primary prophylaxis, especially in patients on HAART with a rise in CD4-lymphocyte count to more than 200 cells/microL, is sufficiently low to warrant discontinuation of primary PCP prophylaxis. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm a similarly low risk for stopping secondary PCP prophylaxis},

SETTING: A teaching hospital in Los Angeles and a university research center in San Diego, California. PATIENTS: 436 patients who had symptoms consistent with primary HIV infection. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical information and levels of HIV antibody, HIV RNA, and p24 antigen. RESULTS: Primary infection was diagnosed in 54 patients (12.4\%). The sensitivity and specificity of the p24 antigen assay were 88.7\% (95\% CI, 77.0\% to 95.7\%) and 100\% (CI, 99.3\% to 100\%), respectively. For the HIV RNA assay, sensitivity was 100\% and specificity was 97.4\% (CI, 94.9\% to 98.9\%). Fever, myalgia, rash, night sweats, and arthralgia occurred more frequently in patients with primary infection (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: No sign or symptom allows targeted screening for primary infection. Although assays for HIV RNA are more sensitive than those for p24 antigen in diagnosing primary infection, they are more expensive and are more likely to yield false-positive results.}

Factors associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding were: mother leaving school before 18 years of age, smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day and use of a dummy. Dummy use may causally reduce breastfeeding or might be a marker for breastfeeding difficulties, There was a dose-response relationship with smoking, with heavier smokers breastfeeding for the shortest time periods.

Lung-fiber content was measured in a subset of cases. Australia had 7,027 cases from 1945 to 2001, with 488 more in January 2002 through June 2003. Incidence rates for Australia per million population {\textgreater} or = 20 years old (1999) were: male 53.3; female 10.2; total 31.8. Rates have continually increased and are the highest reported national rates in the world.

In 88\% of cases (male 90\%, female 61\%), histories of asbestos exposures were obtained. In 80\% of cases with no history of exposure, TEM lung asbestos fiber counts {\textgreater} 200,000 fibers {\textgreater} 2 microm length/g dry lung were obtained, suggesting unrecognized exposure. Australia's high incidence of mesothelioma is related to high past asbestos use, of all fiber types, in a wide variety of settings.

A quantity that is closely linked with the lead time is the overdiagnosis frequency, which is the fraction of screen-detected cancers that would not have been diagnosed in the absence of screening. Reported overdiagnosis estimates have also been variable, ranging from 25\% to greater than 80\% of screen-detected cancers. METHODS: We used three independently developed mathematical models of prostate cancer progression and detection that were calibrated to incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to estimate lead times and the fraction of overdiagnosed cancers due to PSA screening among US men aged 54-80 years in 1985-2000. Lead times were estimated by use of three definitions. We also compared US and earlier estimates from the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) that were calculated by use of a microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model. RESULTS: The models yielded similar estimates for each definition of lead time, but estimates differed across definitions. Among screen-detected cancers that would have been diagnosed in the patients' lifetimes, the estimated mean lead time ranged from 5.4 to 6.9 years across models, and overdiagnosis ranged from 23\% to 42\% of all screen-detected cancers. The original MISCAN model fitted to ERSPC Rotterdam data predicted a mean lead time of 7.9 years and an overdiagnosis estimate of 66\%; in the model that was calibrated to the US data, these were 6.9 years and 42\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The precise definition and the population used to estimate lead time and overdiagnosis can be important drivers of study results and should be clearly specified.},

METHOD: The 145 homosexually active participants were a non-clinical sample recruited in 1986/1987 by advertisement and followed-up in 1991. A structured questionnaire was administered at both times. Items included questions about the nature of the men's sexual relationships and their sexual practices. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the majority of men had sustained safe sex practices. HIV prevention strategies adopted included condom use, avoidance of anal intercourse and negotiated safety (i.e., the negotiated practice of unprotected anal intercourse within regular partnerships of concordant serostatus).

The combination of preclinical incidence and duration that could yield this phenomenon is of tremendous interest to researchers trying to understand the natural history of the disease and to develop efficient screening strategies. In this article, the authors present estimates of the age-specific asymptomatic incidence and average preclinical duration of prostate cancer. The methodological approach is to first estimate the age-specific incidence of new (stage AI) prostate cancers using preclinical prevalence data from autopsy studies performed between 1941 and 1964 and clinical incidence data for the years 1960-1986 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. Then, the preclinical prevalence estimates are divided by the derived preclinical incidence estimates to yield estimates of the average duration of asymptomatic disease. The estimated mean duration among white men is between 11 and 12 years and appears to be approximately 1 year shorter for blacks than for whites. Comparison of the lifetime risks of preclinical and clinical disease suggests that approximately 75\% of prostate cancers will never become diagnosed if clinical incidence remains at levels observed in 1984-1986, prior to the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the population.}

After controlling for potential confounding variables, including those which measured health care use and infant illness, the relative risk of SIDS for infants not being immunised at 6 weeks was 2.1 (95\% confidence interval = 1.2, 3.5). Four percent of cases died within four days of immunisation and 7.6\% of control infants had been immunised within four days of the nominated date. There was a reduced chance of SIDS in the four days immediately following immunisation (OR = 0.5; 95\% CI = 0.2 to 0.9). CONCLUSIONS--Immunisation does not increase the risk of SIDS and may even lower the risk.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Cancer registries have for decades surveyed the development of cancer diseases. Data on incident cases includes demographic variables. Knowledge of the temporal distribution of risk factors on the same variables makes it possible to model the relationship between disease and risk factor. The results of such analyses might be difficult to interpret since they are based on aggregated data. But the availability of these data sources should encourage further exploration of its possibilities and limitations. METHODS The temporal pattern of smoking habits in 5-year birth cohorts from 1890-1949 was established, with data on the proportions of current smokers, former smokers and non-smokers and estimated average daily consumption of tobacco and average duration of smoking. The lung cancer incidence among the cohorts in 1953-1992 was analysed by a model which included an additive excess risk for smokers that depended on daily dose and duration of smoking. RESULTS The lung cancer incidence in later decades was adequately described by the model, which showed a simple relationship with smoking behaviour in the cohorts. For both current smokers and former smokers, the excess risk was about proportional to the daily amount smoked and the 4.5 power of duration of smoking. The age-specific rates for non-smokers were close to a fifth-power curve of age. CONCLUSIONS Even if lung cancer incidence is not determined separately for groups with known smoking habits, plausible estimates of the effect of smoking can be derived if appropriate information is available on temporal smoking habits in the population.},

METHODS: A cohort of HIV-positive individuals was examined. OUTCOMES: Achievement of viral load {\textless}500 copies/ml and "failure" (failure to suppress viral load {\textless}500 copies/ml after 24 weeks or two consecutive measurements above this level after having suppressed below it). Hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the rate in women to that in men were derived using the Cox model. RESULTS: Of 366 male subjects, 79\% were white and 82\% were homosexual. Sixty-three percent of the 91 female subjects were African and 87\% were heterosexual. The median follow-up after HAART was 94 weeks. The baseline CD4 count was higher in men (228 x 106 per liter) than in women (171 x 106 per liter) (p =.01), but the viral load was similar (p =.88). The median time to {\textless}500 copies/ml was 16 weeks. Women achieved a viral load of {\textless}500 copies/ml at a faster rate than men, with an adjusted HR of 1.46 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-2.16; p =.06). Some 261 patients failed treatment (58\% of men and 53\% of women) with an HR of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.51-1.21; p =.27). CONCLUSIONS: Women may achieve virologic suppression at a faster rate than men and have a more durable response. Further research should examine these responses in conjunction with clinical outcomes, because gender differences in virologic response may ultimately be of little relevance if clinical outcomes are similar},

Concentrations of total fibers (coated and uncoated) (LM), crocidolite, amosite, chrysotile, and unidentified amphibole (TEM) (fibers/g dry lung tissue) were measured. Fiber concentrations less than 10 microns in length and greater than or equal to 10 microns in length were separately quantified. By comparing cases (221) and controls (359 LM, 103 TEM), odds ratios for increasing fiber concentrations compared with less than 15,000 fibers/g (LM) and less than 200,000 fibers/g (TEM) (the respective detection limits) were calculated. Univariate analyses showed statistically significant dose-response relationships between odds ratio and fiber concentration for all fiber concentration measures. The relationship between log(odds ratio) and log(fiber concentration) was linear. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, amosite less than 10 microns, and chrysotile less than 10 microns as explanatory variables best described the data. The odds ratios for a X10 increase in fiber concentration (fibers/micrograms) were as follows: crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, 29.4 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 241); chrysotile less than 10 microns, 15.7 (95\% CI, 6.1 to 40); amosite less than 10 microns, 2.3 (95\% CI, 1.0 to 5.3). An additive risk model gave similar results. In a subgroup of cases and controls with only chrysotile in the lungs, a significant trend in odds ratio with increasing fiber content was found.}

We aimed to compare the performance of both types of modeling for providing up-to-date and precise cancer survival estimates. Data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry were used to assess how well both approaches would have been able to predict 5-year relative survival of concurrently diagnosed patients if they had been applied for that purpose throughout the past decades. Analyses were carried out for 20 common forms of cancer. For each cancer, 5-year relative survival was modeled with either approach for each single calendar year from 1962 to 1997. Mean differences and mean squared differences from 5-year relative survival later observed for patients diagnosed in the 5-year period around those calendar years were calculated. Survival estimates obtained by period modeling had much lower standard errors than those obtained by cohort modeling. Furthermore, for a clear majority of cancers, period modeling on average also provided better prediction of 5-year relative survival than cohort modeling. We conclude that, although both modeling strategies have their merits and specific indications, period modeling of survival has distinct advantages for up-to-date and precise estimation of cancer survival in population-based cancer survival studies.}

However, data on behaviour change rates (starting - never to current, quitting - current to ex and lapsing - ex to current) are not readily available and cannot be simply derived from or related to prevalence data.Method A model was constructed to relate prevalence of smoking states to behaviour change rates. It was populated with prevalence of smoking status taken from the General Household Survey together with population structure, age-and sex-specific death rates, and birth rates for England and Wales. This model could be used to calculate past behaviour change given observed prevalence of smoking states or future prevalence of smoking given predicted rates of behaviour change.Results To fit data it was necessary to assume that as they age some ex smokers reclassify themselves as never smokers. In the age band 16-19 years about 9 per cent of never smokers start smoking, and about 5 percent of current smokers quit. In the age band 20-24 years the corresponding figures for starting are about 4 per cent in males and 2 per cent in females, and for quitting about 2 per cent in both. In older age bands the percentages starting are zero or less than zero (indicating reclassifying), and the percentage quitting rises with age. Net lapsing (shift from ex to current) occurred very infrequently and is quantitatively unimportant. If the current starting, quitting and lapsing rates are maintained the Smoking kills target will not be met. Future prevalence of smoking under different scenarios is examined.Conclusion The model is useful in calculating the proportions changing smoking state from serial cross-sectional data on prevalence and for predicting future prevalence.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients either receiving at least one protease inhibitor (n=116) or protease inhibitor- naive (n=32), and healthy men (n=47). INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lipodystrophy was assessed by physical examination and questionnaire and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting triglyceride, cholesterol, free fatty acid, glucose, insulin, C- peptide and fructosamine levels, other metabolic parameters, CD4 lymphocyte counts, and HIV RNA load were also assessed. RESULTS: HIV protease inhibitor-naive patients had similar body composition to healthy men. HIV protease inhibitor therapy was associated with substantially lower total body fat (13.2 versus 18.7 kg in protease inhibitor-naive patients; P=0.005), and significantly higher total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Lipodystrophy was observed clinically in 74 (64\%) protease inhibitor recipients after a mean 13.9 months and 1(3\%) protease inhibitor-naive patient (P=0.0001). Fat loss occurred in all regions except the abdomen after a median 10 months. Patients with lipodystrophy experienced a relative weight loss of 0.5 kg per month and had significantly higher triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and C-peptide levels and were more insulin-resistant than protease inhibitor recipients without lipodystrophy. Patients receiving ritonavir and saquinavir in combination had significantly lower body fat, higher lipids and shorter time to lipodystrophy than patients receiving indinavir. Three (2\%) patients developed new or worsening diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: A syndrome of peripheral lipodystrophy, hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance is a common complication of HIV protease inhibitors. Diabetes mellitus is relatively uncommon},

(1983) [Bayesian confidence intervals for the cross validated smoothing spline. J. R. Statist. Soc. B 45, 133-150] and Silverman, B.W.

This paper aims to improve this situation by providing simulation tests and obtaining asymptotic results supporting the approximations employed for the generalized case. The simulation results suggest that while across-the-model performance is good, component-wise coverage probabilities are not as reliable. Since this is likely to result from the neglect of smoothing parameter variability, a simple and efficient simulation method is proposed to account for smoothing parameter uncertainty: this is demonstrated to substantially improve the performance of component-wise intervals.}

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving combination treatment or interferon alfa-2a. METHODS: RE04/30012 was an open-label randomised trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment-naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimisation to receive interferon alfa-2a alone or combination therapy with interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non-stratified log-rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 46518965. FINDINGS: 502 patients were randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa-2a and 504 to receive combined treatment. Median follow-up was 37.2 months (24.8-52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0-23.2) for patients receiving interferon alfa-2a versus 18.6 months (16.5-20.6) for those receiving combination therapy. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95\% CI 0.90-1.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3\% (-5.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7\% (-8.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23\%) patients receiving interferon alfa-2a and 131 (26\%) of those receiving combined treatment. INTERPRETATION: Although combination therapy does not improve overall or progression-free survival compared with interferon alfa-2a alone, immunotherapy might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from immunotherapy is crucial. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council.},

However, after 1986, the test was performed on many men who had not been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, apparently resulting in the diagnosis of a substantial number of early tumors. Our purpose is to provide insight into the effect of screening on prostate cancer rates. Detailed data are presented for whites because the size of the population allows for calculating statistically reliable rates; however, similar overall trends are seen for African-Americans and other races. METHODS: Prostate cancer incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics were analyzed. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The following findings are consistent with a screening effect: 1) the recent decrease since 1991 in the incidence of distant stage disease, after not having been perturbed by screening; 2) the decline in the incidence of earlier stage disease beginning the following year (i.e., 1992); 3) the recent increases and decreases in prostate cancer incidence and mortality by age that appear to indicate a calendar period effect; and 4) trends in the incidence of distant stage disease by tumor grade and trends in the survival of patients with distant stage disease by calendar year that provide suggestive evidence of the tendency of screening to detect slower growing tumors. IMPLICATIONS: The decline in the incidence of distant stage disease holds the promise that testing for prostate-specific antigen may lead to a sustained decline in prostate cancer mortality. However, population data are complex, and it is difficult to confidently attribute relatively small changes in mortality to any one cause.}

We aimed to quantify this bias in prevalence estimates in 2178 Australian children aged 4-12 years using 12- versus 6-month age intervals. Using the 12-month interval, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was underestimated by 1.4\% compared to the 6-month interval estimates; however, this was age-dependent. It overestimated prevalence for 4-year olds, but underestimated it for older ages by up to 2.6\%. Overweight prevalence was generally affected more than obesity prevalence. The use of different age intervals for IOTF cut-points introduces a small but systematic bias in prevalence estimates of overweight and obesity.}

METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional studies during the period 1996-2001 in Australian capital cities. Men were recruited from a variety of community-based settings, including gay community outdoor events, sex on premises venues, and social venues. They underwent a brief self-administered questionnaire in which they reported their HIV status, HIV-testing history, sexual behaviour and demographic information. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned for 22 161 HIV-negative or status-unknown participants. While 85.3\% had ever tested for HIV, 57.6\% had tested in the last 12 months. Recent testing was greater in those living in Sydney, in younger men, in gay- identified men, in gay community-attached men, in those who reported unprotected anal intercourse and a higher number of sexual partners, and in partners of HIV-positive men. Although recent testing declined from 1996 to 2001, this trend was no longer significant when adjusted for other testing predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In Australia, HIV testing among gay men decreased slightly from 1996 to 2001, but the trend was not significant when adjusted for other predictors. Testing levels were highest among those at highest risk of HIV infection, and lowest among non gay-identified and non gay-community attached homosexual men},

Various limiting factors, including the time needed to transfer research results to clinical practice and a narrow 'window of opportunity', may make it unfeasible to perform trials to test such regimens sequentially against a control treatment in a traditional two-arm parallel group design. We present an approach to trial design based on eliminating inferior contenders at an early stage, allowing through to a second stage only treatments that show a predefined degree of advantage against a control treatment. The first stage of testing utilizes a marker known to be a valid intermediate outcome measure or surrogate for the definitive outcome. The experimental arms are compared pairwise with control according to this intermediate outcome measure. Arms that survive the comparison enter a second stage of patient accrual culminating in comparisons against control on the outcome measure of primary interest. We show how the design may be realized in practice by considering hypothetically distinct trials at stages 1 and 2, each with their own operating characteristics. The overall operating characteristics are computed from the stage 1 and 2 size and power and the correlation between the treatment effects on the intermediate and primary outcome measures according to a bivariate Normal approximation. The correlation is estimated by bootstrapping individual patient data from previous trials. We illustrate the general approach in a design of a real trial of four new chemotherapy regimens for advanced ovarian cancer. The intermediate outcome measure is progression-free survival. An international randomized controlled trial using the new design is already under way.}

	abstract = {Over the last few years, many new genetic associations have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). There are potentially many uses of these identified variants: a better understanding of disease etiology, personalized medicine, new leads for studying underlying biology, and risk prediction. Recently, there has been some skepticism regarding the prospects of risk prediction using GWAS, primarily motivated by the fact that individual effect sizes of variants associated with the phenotype are mostly small. However, there have also been arguments that many disease-associated variants have not yet been identified; hence, prospects for risk prediction may improve if more variants are included. From a risk prediction perspective, it is reasonable to average a larger number of predictors, of which some may have (limited) predictive power, and some actually may be noise. The idea being that when added together, the combined small signals results in a signal that is stronger than the noise from the unrelated predictors. We examine various aspects of the construction of models for the estimation of disease probability. We compare different methods to construct such models, to examine how implementation of cross-validation may influence results, and to examine which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are most useful for prediction. We carry out our investigation on GWAS of the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium. For Crohn's disease, we confirm our results on another GWAS. Our results suggest that utilizing a larger number of SNPs than those which reach genome-wide significance, for example using the lasso, improves the construction of risk prediction models. Genet.

The 5 Japanese tumor samples contained 3 point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras and 2 mutations in codon 12 of N-ras respectively. One tumor in a Hawaiian Japanese man also showed a K-ras point mutation at codon 12. Two Colombians and one U.S. black man had tumors with mutations at codon 61 of H-ras, while 1 Colombian showed an N-ras mutation at this codon. The overall frequency of ras gene mutations was low, but point mutations in codon 12 were most common in latent tumors of Japanese, who experienced the lowest incidence and mortality from this tumor. Latent tumors in men from ethnic groups with high mortality and incidence rates showed fewer ras mutations than the Japanese, and these were more likely to involve codon 61. This finding is consistent with prior studies of more aggressive clinical cancers in Japanese men that indicated a higher frequency of mutations at codon 61.}

DESIGN: Case-control study nested in a retrospective cohort of 2048 HIV-1 positive patients. Cases were defined as patients with a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis, and controls as patients with AIDS and without tuberculosis during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 627 patients diagnosed with AIDS, 121 had a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis. Significant risk factors for tuberculosis in the univariate analysis were sex, ethnicity, age, HIV exposure category and hospital attended, and in the multiple regression analysis ethnicity, age and hospital attended. African ethnicity was the strongest risk factor for tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.9, 95\% confidence interval 3.4-10.2). The risk of tuberculosis was higher in the younger age groups (test for trend P {\textless} 0.001). The hospital-associated risk of tuberculosis was more heterogeneous in the non-African group, and non-Africans attending Hospital 1 had an increased risk of tuberculosis which was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for AIDS-associated tuberculosis in London are sub-Saharan African origin, younger age group, and, among the non-Africans only, attending one hospital in east London. Different transmission patterns and mechanisms for the development of tuberculosis may operate in different settings depending on the background risk of tuberculous infection. Screening for tuberculosis infection and disease among HIV-positive individuals in London is important for the provision of preventive or curative therapy, and prophylaxis policies need to be designed in accordance with the transmission patterns and mechanisms of disease},

Follow-up of these cohorts has now been extended to 1982 and, moreover, individual job histories, which were not available in 1984, have been constructed. In this study, lung cancer mortality in these cohorts of coke oven workers with extended follow-up was analyzed using standard techniques of survival analysis and a new approach based on the two stage clonal expansion model of carcinogenesis. The latter approach allows the explicit consideration of detailed patterns of exposure of each individual in the cohort.

Functional data models with time series coefficients are used to model age-specific mortality and fertility rates. As detailed migration data are lacking, net migration by age and sex is estimated as the diffierence between historic annual population data and successive populations one year ahead derived from a projection using fertility and mortality data. This estimate, which includes error. is also modeled using a functional data model. The three models involve different strengths of the general Box-Cox transformation chosen to minimise out-of-sample forecast error. Uncertainty is estimated from the model, with an adjustment to ensure that the one-step-forecast variances are equal to those obtained with historical data. The three models are then used in a Monte Carlo simulation of future fertility, mortality and net migration, which are combined using the cohort-component method to obtain age-specific forcecasts is of the population by sex. The distribution of the forecasts provides probabilistic prediction intervals. The method is demonstrated by making, 20-year forecasts using Australian data for the period 1921-2004. The advantages of our method are: (I) it is a coherent stochastic model of the three demographic components; (2) it is estimated entirely from historical data with no subjective inputs required: and (3) it provides probabilistic prediction intervals for any demographic variable that is derived from population numbers and vital events, including life expectancies, total fertility rates and dependency ratios.

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PSA screening, with and without adjustment for quality of life, for the British Columbia (BC) population. We adapted an existing natural history model using BC incidence, treatment, cost and mortality patterns. The modeled mortality benefit of screening derives from a stage-shift mechanism, assuming mortality reduction consistent with the European Study of Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer. The model projected outcomes for 40-year-old men under 14 combinations of screening ages and frequencies. Cost and utility estimates were explored with deterministic sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness of regular screening ranged from \$36,300/LYG, for screening every four years from ages 55 to 69 years, to \$588,300/LYG, for screening every two years from ages 40 to 74 years. The marginal benefits of increasing screening frequency to 2 years or starting screening at age 40 years were small and came at significant cost. After utility adjustment, all screening strategies resulted in a loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); however, this result was very sensitive to utility estimates. Plausible outcomes under a range of screening strategies inform discussion of prostate cancer screening policy in BC and similar jurisdictions. Screening may be cost-effective, but the sensitivity of results to utility values suggests individual preferences for quality versus quantity of life should be a key consideration.},

We investigated absolute and relative CVD risk in 76,600 patients with PC undergoing ET, curative treatment, or surveillance. METHODS: PCBaSe Sweden is based on the National Prostate Cancer Register, which covers more than 96\% of PC cases. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke were calculated to compare observed and expected (using total Swedish population) numbers of CVD, taking into account age, calendar time, and previous CVD. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2007, 30,642 patients with PC received primary ET, 26,432 curative treatment, and 19,527 surveillance. SIRs for CVD were elevated in all men with the highest for those undergoing ET, independent of circulatory disease history (SIR MI for men without circulatory disease history: 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.31 to 1.49], 1.15 [95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.31], and 1.20 [95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.30] for men undergoing ET, curative treatment, and surveillance, respectively). Absolute risk differences (ARD) showed that two (arrhythmia) to eight (IHD) extra cases of CVD would occur per 1,000 person-years. SMRs showed similar patterns, with ARD of zero (arrhythmia) to three (IHD) per 1,000 person-years. CONCLUSION: Increased relative risks of nonfatal and fatal CVD were found among all men with PC, especially those treated with ET. Because ET is currently the only effective treatment for metastatic disease and the ARDs were rather small, our findings indicate that CVD risk should be considered when prescribing ET but should not constitute a contraindication when the expected gain is tangible.},

METHODS: Incidence and follow-up data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (1975-2001) were used to calculate the number of survivors with more than one malignant primary at January 1, 2002. U.S. prevalence counts were calculated by multiplying the age, sex, and race-specific prevalence proportions from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program by the corresponding U.S. populations. RESULTS: We estimate that 756,467 people in the United States have been affected by cancer more than once between 1975 and 2001, representing almost 8\% of the current cancer survivor population. Women whose first primary in that period was breast cancer represent 25\% of survivors with multiple cancers, followed by men and women (15\%) whose first primary was colorectal cancer and men (13\%) whose first primary was prostate cancer. DISCUSSION: The findings in this report have important implications for public health practice. With individuals diagnosed with cancer living longer and the aging of the U.S. population, the number who will develop multiple malignancies is expected to increase. As a consequence, there is a growing need to promote effective cancer screening along with healthy life-styles among these at-risk populations if we are to ensure optimal physical and psychosocial well-being of these long-term cancer survivors and their families. Efforts to design and evaluate effective, efficient, and equitable approaches to surveillance for second malignancies will be critical in reducing the national burden of cancer.}

This study examines the psychological health consequences of gender divisions in emotional work. Quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 102 couples with young children show that the gender imbalance affected women's, but not men's, experience of love and conflict in their marriage. Through this erosion of the marriage, the gender imbalance posed a health risk to women and helped explain gender differences in psychological distress. Couples preserved a sense of mutuality by accounting for the gender imbalance as something beyond men's choice or control, or in terms of women's excess emotional needs, thus entrenching gender differences in the performance and consequences of emotional work.}

The methods proposed by Bray and Parkin, and Parkin and Bray (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:747-64) were applied to the registry data from 1990 to 2009 to assess comparability, validity and completeness. The system used for classification and coding of neoplasms followed international standards. The percentage of cases morphologically verified was 18.1\% for men and 33.1\% for women, and that of death certificate only cases was 6.6 and 3.6\%, respectively. Incidence rates in rural regions were lower than in the urban part of the country, except amongst young male adults. Comparison with other West African registries showed that the incidences of liver and uterine cervical cancer were comparable, but those of prostate and breast in The Gambia were relatively low. The overall completeness was estimated at 50.3\% using the capture-recapture method. The GNCR applies international standard practices to data collection and handling, providing valuable data on cancer incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the data are incomplete in the rural and elderly populations probably because of health care access and use.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal study of people with known date of seroconversion to HIV. SETTING: 16 HIV treatment centres throughout Italy. SUBJECTS: 1199 people infected with HIV through use of injected drugs, homosexual sex, or heterosexual sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AIDS as defined by 1987 definition of Centers for Disease Control (including and excluding neoplasms) and by 1993 European definition. RESULTS: 225 subjects (18.8\%) progressed to AIDS (Centers for Disease Control 1987 definition) during median follow up of 5.8 years. Univariate analyses showed more rapid progression to AIDS for older subjects compared with younger subjects and for homosexual men compared with other exposure categories. The age effect was of similar size in each exposure category and in men and women. In a bivariate model with age and exposure categories simultaneously included as covariates, differences by exposure category disappeared for use of injected drugs and heterosexual sex compared with homosexual sex (relative hazards 1.02 (95\% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.45) and 1.07 (0.70 to 1.64) respectively), while the age effect remained (relative hazard 1.55 (1.32 to 1.83) for 10 year increase in age). Analyses using the other definitions for AIDS did not appreciably change these results. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of differences in rate of development of AIDS by exposure category, while there was a strong tendency for more rapid development in older subjects for all three groups. This supports the view that external cofactors do not play major role in AIDS pathogenesis but that age is of fundamental importance},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of distant stage prostate carcinoma was relatively flat until 1991 and then started declining rapidly. This decline probably was caused by the shift to earlier stage disease associated with the rapid dissemination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. Prostate carcinoma mortality rates started falling at approximately the same time. In this article, the authors model the potential impact of this stage shift on prostate carcinoma mortality rates given various assumptions concerning the survival of patients with screen-detected local-regional disease. METHODS: The authors used the CAN*TROL 2 computer model to shift each deficit in the number of patients with distant stage disease to local-regional stage disease and modeled the implications on mortality using a set of base, optimistic, and pessimistic survival assumptions. A base survival assumes that a patient with screen-detected local-regional disease of a certain histologic grade has the same prognosis as a patient with clinically detected local-regional disease of same grade (i.e., an assumption of no length bias for patients with screen-detected disease), whereas the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios assume that survival is better or worse, respectively, than the base survival (i.e., complete cure for patients with favorable grade for the optimistic scenario and no improvements in survival for patients with unfavorable grade for the pessimistic scenario). RESULTS: Model results were compared with observed mortality trends. Rising age-adjusted mortality rates peaked in 1991 for white males and in 1993 for black males and then fell 21\% and 13\% for white males and black males, respectively, from 1990 through 1999. Under the modeled stage-shift intervention, mortality rates would fall 18\%, 8\%, and 19\% for both white males and black males under the base, pessimistic, and optimistic assumptions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is impossible to know what the mortality trends would have been in the absence of the introduction of PSA screening. However, under the base assumption, it appears that the decline in distant stage disease can have a fairly sizable and rapid impact on population mortality. The optimistic scenario is not much improved over the base scenario, which is indicative of the facts that the survival of patients diagnosed with clinical local-regional prostate carcinoma is quite good and that further survival improvements can have only a marginal impact. Under the pessimistic scenario, it appears that something else must be responsible for much of the decline in mortality. Screening trial results from the United States and Europe may verify and isolate the size of any mortality benefit associated with PSA screening. Trial results eventually can be put back into these population models to help quantify the impact of screening, treatment, and other factors on population trends.}

Our aim was to assess the ecological association between national death rates from diseases associated with asbestos and historical consumption of asbestos. METHODS: We calculated, for all countries with data, yearly age-adjusted mortality rates by sex (deaths per million population per year) for each disease associated with asbestos (pleural, peritoneal, and all mesothelioma, and asbestosis) in 2000-04 and mean per head asbestos consumption (kg per person per year) in 1960-69. We regressed death rates for the specified diseases against historical asbestos consumption, weighted by the size of sex-specific national populations. FINDINGS: Historical asbestos consumption was a significant predictor of death for all mesothelioma in both sexes (adjusted R2=0.74, p{\textless}0.0001, 2.4-fold [95\% CI 2.0-2.9] mortality increase was predicted per unit consumption increase for men; 0.58, p{\textless}0.0001, and 1.6-fold [1.4-1.9] mortality increase was predicted for women); for pleural mesothelioma in men (0.29, p=0.0015, 1.8-fold [1.3-2.5]); for peritoneal mesothelioma in both sexes (0.54, p{\textless}0.0001, 2.2-fold [1.6-2.9] for men, 0.35, p=0.0008, and 1.4-fold for women [1.2-1.6]); and for asbestosis in men (0.79, p{\textless}0.0001, 2.7-fold [2.2-3.4]). Linear regression lines consistently had intercepts near zero. INTERPRETATION: Within the constraints of an ecological study, clear and plausible associations were shown between deaths from the studied diseases and historical asbestos consumption, especially for all mesothelioma in both sexes and asbestosis in men. Our data strongly support the recommendation that all countries should move towards eliminating use of asbestos.}

Significant excess risks were seen for agriculture-related industries, soap and perfume manufacture, and leather processing industries. Significantly elevated standardized incidence ratios were also seen for the following occupations: farmers, leather workers, and white-collar occupations. Our results suggest that farmers; certain occupations and industries with exposures to cadmium, herbicides, and fertilizers; and men with low occupational physical activity levels have elevated prostate cancer risks.

BACKGROUND: Aspirin and ACEi both reduce mortality when given early after MI. Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins, and, in principle, this inhibition might antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. But it is uncertain whether, in practice, this influences the effects of ACEi on mortality and major morbidity after MI. METHODS: This overview sought individual patient data from all trials involving more than 1,000 patients randomly allocated to receive ACEi or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible trial). RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 7.1\% among patients allocated to ACEi and 7.6\% among those allocated to control, corresponding to a 7\% (standard deviation [SD], 2\%) proportional reduction (95\% confidence interval 2\% to 11\%, p = 0.004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was associated with similar proportional reductions in 30-day mortality among the 86,484 patients who were taking ASA (6\% [SD, 3\%] reduction) and among the 10,228 patients who were not (10\% [SD, 5\%] reduction: chi-squared test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 0.5). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor produced definite increases in the incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9\% ACEi vs. 9.4\% control) and of renal dysfunction (1.3\% ACEi vs. 0.6\% control), but there was no good evidence that these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-squared for heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant). Nor was there good evidence that the effects of ACEi on other clinical outcomes were changed by concomitant ASA use. CONCLUSIONS: Both ASA and ACEi are beneficial in acute MI. The present results support the early use of ACEi in acute MI, irrespective of whether or not ASA is being given.}

DESIGN: Register-based retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia. Age-, sex-, and period- adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for individual cancers occurring in 1980-1993 in people with AIDS registered before 1996. RESULTS: During the study period, 3616 people were registered with AIDS; 716 cases of AIDS-defining cancer and 62 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer were identified. People with AIDS had a significantly increased incidence of Hodgkin's disease [SIR 18.3; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 8.39-34.8], multiple myeloma (SIR 12.1; 95\% CI 2.50-35.4), leukaemia (SIR 5.76; 95\% CI 1.57-14.7), lip cancer (SIR 5.94; 95\% CI 1.92-13.8) and lung cancer (SIR 3.80; 95\% CI 1.39-8.29). The incidence of Hodgkin's disease increased significantly around the time of AIDS diagnosis (P = 0.008 for trend with time), suggesting an association with immunodeficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong support for the hypothesis that Hodgkin's disease is an AIDS- associated condition. There was an increased incidence of several other forms of cancer, some of which are known to occur at increased rates in transplant recipients who have received immunosuppressive therapy. Improved survival in people with HIV infection may lead to increases in the number that develop these forms of cancer},

Subjects were participants in the Italian Seroconverters Study, a seroincident cohort of more than 1,200 adults seen at ambulatory care clinics in Italy, with observed HIV seroconversion in 1980-1988. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnoses, based on the 1987 Centers for Disease Control case definition, and mortality were ascertained through Italian national registries through 1994. To estimate bias in prevalent cohorts, a series of pseudoseroprevalent (PSP) cohorts were drawn by sampling, from among the total seroincident cohort, prevalent AIDS-free subjects in each calendar year. The relative AIDS risk associated with a given covariate was calculated in each PSP cohort and compared with the relative AIDS risk for that covariate in the seroincident cohort. Relative risks were estimated by both the ratio of AIDS incidence densities and the relative AIDS hazards from proportional hazards regression. Differential length bias was not evident, as assessed in the following way: Among 338 individuals with seroconversion dates in 1983-1986, the relative risk of AIDS for subjects born before 1951 compared with those born more recently was 1.67 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-2.14). Although differential length-biased sampling was expected to bias this relative risk toward 1.0, the observed relative risk for earlier birth ranged from 1.79 to 2.86 in 1987-1992 PSP cohorts. Onset bias was observed: Among 644 subjects with seroconversion in 1980-1988, the AIDS relative risk for 1980-1985 seroconverters compared with 1986-1988 seroconverters was 1.09 (95\% CI 0.76-1.55). Onset bias was seen in 1988-1990 PSP cohorts (relative risks for early seroconversion = 1.47, 1.46, and 1.34, respectively); in 1991-1992, relative risks were close to the expected value of 1.09, and CIs on relative risks from all PSP cohorts after 1989 included 1.0. Confounding attributable to differential length-biased sampling in prevalent cohorts does not necessarily bias estimates of the impact of covariates on rate of progression to AIDS. Bias can arise when a covariate suspected of affecting AIDS risk is closely linked to date of acquisition of HIV infection. However, onset bias appears to wane as subjects' dates of infection become more remote},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

In the absence of unmeasured confounding factors and model misspecification, standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival are biased when (i) there exists a time-dependent risk factor for survival that also predicts subsequent treatment and (ii) past treatment history predicts subsequent risk factor level. In contrast, structural models provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. The parameters of nested structural models are estimated by g-estimation and those of marginal structural models by inverse probability weighting.


METHODS

We describe a nested structural accelerated failure time model and use it to estimate the total causal effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the time to AIDS or death among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort and Women's Interagency HIV Studies. The Appendix describes g-estimation and methods to deal with censoring.


RESULTS

Comparing the regime 'always treated' to 'never treated,' the AIDS-free survival time ratio was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 3.3).


CONCLUSIONS

Our finding of a strongly beneficial effect is consistent with results from randomized trials and from a previous analysis of the same data using a marginal structural Cox model. In contrast, a previous analysis using a standard (non-structural) model did not find an effect of treatment on survival.},

Some discussions on sample size calculation under Poisson model appear elsewhere, but all these focus on the case of testing equality rather than testing equivalence. We discuss sample size and power calculation on the basis of exact distribution under Poisson models for testing non-inferiority and equivalence with respect to the mean incidence rate ratio. On the basis of large sample theory, we further develop an approximate sample size calculation formula using the normal approximation of a proposed test statistic for testing non-inferiority and an approximate power calculation formula for testing equivalence. We find that using these approximation formulae tends to produce an underestimate of the minimum required sample size calculated from using the exact test procedure. On the other hand, we find that the power corresponding to the approximate sample sizes can be actually accurate (with respect to Type I error and power) when we apply the asymptotic test procedure based on the normal distribution. We tabulate in a variety of situations the minimum mean incidence needed in the standard (or the control) population, that can easily be employed to calculate the minimum required sample size from each comparison group for testing non-inferiority and equivalence between two Poisson populations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

METHODS: Between 1993 and 1999, a total of 43,987 men, aged 55-74 years, were included in the intervention arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) section in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland. A total of 42,503 men, aged 55-74 years, were included in a clinical population in Northern Ireland. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {\textless}20.0 ng/mL was measured in all men at study entry. All men were followed for prostate cancer incidence and causes of death until December 31, 2006. RESULTS: The adjusted absolute difference in prostate cancer specific mortality between the intervention population and the clinical population increased with increasing PSA level at study entry, ie, 0.05 per 10,000 person-years for men who had a serum PSA level of 0.0-1.9 ng/mL and 8.8 per 10,000 person-years for men who had a serum PSA level of 10-19.9 ng/mL. To evaluate the risks of early detection, the number needed to investigate (NNI) and number needed to treat (NNT) to save 1 death from prostate cancer were calculated. Both NNI and NNT were higher for those who had lower PSA levels at study entry. The NNI was 24,642 men for patients who had a serum PSA level of 0.0-1.9 ng/mL and was 133 men for patients who had a serum PSA level of 10-19.9 ng/mL; the NNT was 724 men for patients who had a serum PSA level of 0.0-1.9 ng/mL and was 60 men for patients with a serum PSA level of 10-19.9 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: For men with a low serum PSA level, the benefits of aggressive investigation and treatment may be limited because they are associated with a large increase in cumulative incidence and potential overtreatment.},

METHODS: Observed LC trends for 1955-1985 for both sexes and three age groups were compared with multistage model predictions using smoking history data from two surveys (HALS, AHIP). The modelling used the individual smoking data directly or aggregated prevalence estimates. It allowed for variation in age of starting and stopping smoking, amount smoked, tar levels, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure. RESULTS: Observed male LC rates fell faster than predicted by a model (with the first and penultimate stages assumed affected by smoking) that allowed for variation in amount smoked and in tar level (with some provision for "compensation"), and was based on aggregated smoking data from HALS. The discrepancy equated to an annual change unexplained by smoking of -2.4\%, -2.8\%, and -1.9\% for ages 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64. The annual unexplained changes were less in women, and reversed at age 55-64; -1.7\%, -0.8\%, and +0.8\% for the three ages. They were similar using individual smoking histories (-2.6\%, -1.8\%, and -1.6\%; women, -0.9\%, -0.5\%, and +0.2\%). The discrepancies were unexplained by plausible alternative multistage parameters, full allowance for tar reduction, alternative estimates of amount smoked, or ETS. CONCLUSIONS: British LC trends cannot be fully explained by cigarette consumption trends, implying factors other than cigarette smoking contribute importantly to overall risk. Predictions using aggregated prevalence estimates provide useful information.}

Sensitivities to the choice of baseline data and values of key parameters were assessed. Lead-time estimates in men diagnosed aged 55-59 years were 14.1, 9.3 and 5.0 years for men with Gleason scores {\textless}7, 7 and {\textgreater}7, respectively, assuming biennial screening with 100\% attendance.

For men aged 55-59 years at diagnosis, the predicted absolute 15-year survival benefit from curative treatment was 0, 12 and 26\% for men with Gleason scores {\textless}7, 7 and {\textgreater}7, respectively. Estimates of the survival benefit of radical treatment were relatively insensitive to values of key parameters. The case for curative treatment, rather than conservative management, of screen-detected localised prostate cancer is strongest in men with high-grade disease. This conclusion contrasts with current patterns of care.}

METHODS: In 1993, PSA testing was made freely available to men aged 45 to 75 years in the Federal State of Tyrol, Austria. At least two thirds of all men in this age range have been tested at least once during the first 5 years of the study. Initially, only total PSA was measured, but free PSA measurement was added in 1995. The IMX assay was used. Digital rectal examination was not part of the screening examination. RESULTS: Significant migration to lower stages has been observed since the introduction of this screening program. A reduction in mortality rates in the rest of Austria from 1993 onward has occurred, with the reduction in Tyrol much greater; the mortality remained fairly constant between 1993 and 1995 and subsequently fell. The trends in prostate cancer mortality rates since 1993 differ significantly between Tyrol (P = 0.006) and the rest of Austria. On the basis of the age-specific death rates averaged from 1986 to 1990, the difference between the number of expected and observed deaths from prostate cancer in Tyrol was 22 in the group aged 40 to 79 years in 1998 and 18 the following year. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the policy of making PSA testing freely available, and the wide acceptance by men in the population, is associated with a reduction in prostate cancer mortality in an area in which urology services and radiotherapy are available freely to all patients. It is our opinion that most of this decline is likely to be due to aggressive downstaging and successful treatment and that any contribution from detecting and treating early cancers will only become apparent in the years to come.}

We predict that for all cancers combined there will be relatively little change in age-standardised incidence rates in 2020. The number of new cancer cases per year in England is, however, predicted to increase by 33\%, from 224,000 in 2001 to 299,000 cases in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the anticipated effects of population growth and ageing; cancer patients in 2020 will be older than today's cancer population.}

A recent study analysed changes in the rates of cardiac emergencies in Bavaria (Germany) during the last Football World Cup. The authors reported a 2.7-fold increase in the incidence of cardiac emergencies in the 12 h before and after football matches involving the German team, which sparked the debate on the necessity of the introduction of ad hoc cardiovascular preventive measures. METHODS: We studied 25,159 hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among the Italian population during three international football competitions: the World Cup 2002, the European Championship 2004 and the World Cup 2006. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of hospital admission for AMI on the days when football matches involving the Italian team were disputed, compared with the other days of the three competitions. Furthermore, we reviewed the available published studies regarding the association between football matches and the risk of cardiovascular events. RESULTS: We did not find an increase in the rates of admission for AMI on the days of football matches involving Italy in either the single competitions or the three competitions combined (relative risk 1.01; 95\% confidence interval 0.98-1.05). We identified 10 studies published on this topic. With the exception of the recently published German study and two small Swiss studies, all relative risk estimates were between 0.7 and 1.3. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular effects of watching football matches are likely to be, if anything, very small.},

We found that, in early puberty, exposed and nonexposed adolescents did not differ in MRI-based measures of adiposity. In late puberty, on the other hand, exposed compared with nonexposed adolescents demonstrated markedly higher quantities of both subcutaneous fat (by 26\%, P = 0.004) and intra-abdominal fat (by 33\%, P = 0.001). These group differences remained virtually unchanged after adjusting for sex and potential confounders, including birth weight and breastfeeding.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial showed a statistically significant 29\% prostate cancer mortality reduction for the men screened in the intervention arm and a 23\% negative impact on the life-years gained because of quality of life. However, alternative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies for the population may exist, optimizing the effects on mortality reduction, quality of life, overdiagnosis, and costs.
METHODS: Based on data of the ERSPC trial, we predicted the numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed, prostate cancer deaths averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, and cost-effectiveness of 68 screening strategies starting at age 55 years, with a PSA threshold of 3, using microsimulation modeling. The screening strategies varied by age to stop screening and screening interval (one to 14 years or once in a lifetime screens), and therefore number of tests.
RESULTS: Screening at short intervals of three years or less was more cost-effective than using longer intervals. Screening at ages 55 to 59 years with two-year intervals had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$73000 per QALY gained and was considered optimal. With this strategy, lifetime prostate cancer mortality reduction was predicted as 13\%, and 33\% of the screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. When better quality of life for the post-treatment period could be achieved, an older age of 65 to 72 years for ending screening was obtained.
CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer screening can be cost-effective when it is limited to two or three screens between ages 55 to 59 years. Screening above age 63 years is less cost-effective because of loss of QALYs because of overdiagnosis.},

METHOD: Suicide rates were stratified by approximate equal-population quintiles of area-based SES for the period 1979-2003 and examined across five quinquennia, centred on each Australian Census from 1981 to 2001, to determine if (1) SES differentials in suicide have persisted over time, and (2) if SES differentials have widened or narrowed. Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth, and urban-rural residence using Poisson regression models, and secular changes in SES differentials were assessed using trend tests on suicide rate ratios (low to high SES quintiles). RESULTS: Socio-economic status (SES) differentials persisted across the study period for both males and females after adjusting for the effects of age, migrant status, and urban-rural residence, with the largest differences between low and high SES groups evident in males, and especially young males (20-34 years). For males, suicide rates increased significantly in all SES groups until 1998, before diverging significantly in the most recent 5-year period, particularly in younger males (P{\textless}0.0001). In young males, suicide rates in the most recent period increased in the low SES group from 44.8 in 1994-1998 to 48.6 in 1999-2003 (an 8\% increase). In contrast, suicide rates in the middle SES group decreased from a peak of 37.3 to 33.5 (a 10\% decrease), and in the high SES group from a peak of 33.0 to 27.9 (a 15\% decrease). A similar statistically significant divergence of a lesser magnitude was also evident in all age males and younger females (20-34 years). CONCLUSION: This study shows that SES differentials in suicide persisted in Australia for most of the period 1979-2004. The decline in suicide in young males in the most recent quinquennium was limited to middle and high SES groups, while the low SES group displayed a continued increase. The continued increase in suicide in low SES males has implications for social and economic intervention and suicide control programs.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND. Cancer incidence and mortality rates both began to decline in the U.S. in the early 1990s. Recognizing the unprecedented potential benefits of accelerating this decline, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has set ambitious challenge goals for the American public for a 25\% reduction in cancer incidence rates and a 50\% reduction in cancer mortality rates by the year 2015. This analysis examined the feasibility of reaching those goals by estimating future changes in cancer rates that can result from past and future reductions in cancer risk factors.METHODS, Estimates for future declines in cancer risk factors in the U.S. under alternative scenarios were applied to conservative population-attributable risk estimates for cancer incidence and mortality rates in 1990 to estimate cancer rate trends in the year 2015.RESULTS. If the current trends toward a decline in the prevalence of cancer risk factors continue over the next: decade, by the year 2015 one can expect a 13\% decline in cancer incidence rates and a 21\% decline in cancer mortality rates below their 1990 levels. With redoubled efforts to reduce the prevalence of known cancer risk factors further, by the year 2015 cancer incidence rates could be reduced by 19\% and cancer mortality rates reduced by 29\%. Such redoubled efforts would equate to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 60,000 cancer deaths prevented each year by the year 2015.CONCLUSIONS. Past reductions in cancer risk factors in the U.S. population have led to recent declines in the rates of cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S. Redoubled efforts to act on current knowledge regarding how to prevent, detect, and treat cancer can result in attaining approximately 80\% of the ACS challenge goal for cancer incidence rates and 60\% of the ACS challenge goal for cancer mortality rates by the par 2015. New findings from cancer research are needed and will have to be applied quickly if the ACS challenge goals are to be met fully. Cancer 1999;86:715-27. (C) 1999 American Cancer Society.},

METHODS: Ninety thousand under-screened women were randomised to be mailed a 48-month reminder letter to have a Pap test (n=60,000), or not to be mailed a letter (n=30,000). Differences in Pap test rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, by chi2 tests of significance between Pap test rates in letter versus no-letter groups, and by proportional hazards regression modelling of predictors of a Pap test with letter versus no-letter as the main study variable. T-tests were conducted on mean time to Pap test to assess whether time to Pap test was significantly different between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: After 90 days following each mail-out, Pap test rates in the letter group were significantly higher than in the non-letter group, by approximately two percentage points. After controlling for potential confounders, the hazard ratio of a Pap test within 90 days of a mail-out in the letter group was 1.5 compared with 1.0 in the no-letter group. Hazard ratios of having a Pap test within 90 days decreased significantly with time since last Pap test (p{\textless}0.0001); were significantly higher than 1.0 for most non-metropolitan areas of NSW compared with metropolitan areas; and increased significantly with age (p{\textless}0.0001). Pap test hazard ratios were not associated with socio-economic status of area of residence, but the hazard ratio was significantly higher than 1.0 if the reminder letter was sent after the Christmas/New Year break. No significant differences in mean time to Pap test were found between the letter and no-letter groups. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Being sent a reminder letter is associated with higher Pap testing rates in under-screened women.}

A questionnaire was mailed to the study population to collect data on ED, and the quality of life, both general and disorder related. The prevalence of ED was measured with the direct question 'Do you have problems getting an erection?'. The influence of ED on sexual function was measured with the Dutch version of the Sexual Function Inventory questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy percent of all men (n = 1233) and 73\% of their partners (n = 1071) responded to the questionnaire. The prevalence of ED increased with age class. To the question regarding problems to get an erection, 13\% (95\% confidence interval: 11-15\%) of all men answered affirmatively (40-49 years: 6\%; 50-59: 9\%; 60-69: 22\%; 70-79: 38\%). All men aged 40-49 years of age with ED and 16\% of men aged 70-79 with ED considered their ED as bothersome. Amongst 40 to 49 year old men with ED, 64\% considered their ED as a big or rather a big problem. Amongst older men this percentage was much smaller: 50-59 years: 38\%; 60-69: 37\%, and 70-79: 27\%. Thirty-four percent of all men with ED and 16\% of their spouses were dissatisfied with their sex life. Twenty-five percent of men with ED consulted a doctor, with a mean delay of 13 months. ED bore a strong correlation with the general quality of life and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: ED was a common disorder within the population. Its prevalence was higher among older age groups, but they regarded ED as less of a problem than the younger age groups. Only a quarter of all men with ED consulted a physician.}

METHODS: All data came from a structured telephone survey of a population-based quota sample designed to determine the cancer prevention needs of multiethnic blacks and Hispanics in New York, NY, in 1992. The study included 1420 women of 7 racial/ethnic groups: US-born blacks, English-speaking Caribbean-born blacks, Haitian blacks, and Puerto Rican, Dominican, Colombian, and Ecuadorian Hispanics. The main outcome measures were ever and recently having had a Papanicolaou smear, clinical breast examination (CBE), or mammogram. RESULTS: Among respondents who qualified for the survey on the basis of age and ethnicity, the refusal rate for completing the interview was 2.1\%. Compared with women without a usual site of care, those with a usual site, but no regular clinician, were 1.56, 2.45 (P {\textless} or = .01), and 2.32 (P {\textless} or = .05) times as likely ever to have received a Papanicolaou smear, CBE, or mammogram, respectively and 1.84, 1.92 (P {\textless} or = .05), and 1.75 times as likely to have received a recent Papanicolaou smear, CBE, or mammogram, respectively. Compared with women without a usual site of care, women with a regular clinician at that usual site of care were 2.63 (P {\textless} or = .01), 2.83 (P {\textless} or = .01), and 2.30 (P {\textless} or = .05) times as likely ever to have received a Papanicolaou smear, CBE, or mammogram, and were 2.00 (P {\textless} or = .05), 2.65 (P {\textless} or = .01), and 1.40 times as likely to have recently received a Papanicolaou smear, CBE, or mammogram, respectively (adjusted odds ratios). For uninsured women, presence of a usual site of care was associated with increases in recent use of cancer screening for all screening tests. CONCLUSIONS: There is a linear trend in increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates when one goes from having no usual source of care, to having a usual source, and to having a regular clinician at that usual source. Emphasis on continuity of care, especially on usual source of care, may help to bridge the gap in access to cancer prevention services faced by minority women.}

	annote = {Approximately three million workers in the United States are estimated to be exposed to silica, man-made mineral fibers, and asbestos. The lung is the primary target organ of concern. Each of these substances is composed predominantly of silicon and oxygen; asbestos and silica are crystalline, and asbestos and man-made mineral fibers are fibers. Man-made mineral fibers and asbestos are used as insulating agents, with the former having generally replaced the latter in recent years. Silica is used in foundries, pottery, and brick making, and is encountered by miners. A meta-analysis of 16 of the largest studies with well-documented silica exposure and low probability of confounding by other occupational exposures, indicates a relative risk (RR) of 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.4). Lung cancer risks are highest and most consistent for silicotics, who have received the highest doses (RR = 2.3, CI = 2.2-2.4, across 19 studies). The data for mineral fibers continue to support the International Association for Research on Cancer's 1988 judgment that mineral fibers are a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B). Recent epidemiologic studies provide little evidence for lung carcinogenicity for either glass wool or rock/slag wool. Ceramic fibers, a much less common exposure than glass wool and rock/slag wool, are of concern because of positive animal studies, but there are insufficient human data. Regarding asbestos, its carcinogenicity for the lung and mesothelium is well established. With regard to the controversy over chrysotile and mesothelioma, the data suggest chrysotile does cause mesothelioma, although it may be less potent than amphibole asbestos.}

By 1980, 535 (81\%) men and 123 (19\%) women had been diagnosed with the disease; only 14 persons were aged less than 35 years at the time of diagnosis (the youngest person was 15 years of age). The incidence rate in subjects who were 35 years or older at diagnosis was less than 1.0 cases per million person-years until 1964-1968, and then it rose progressively to 15.5 cases per million person-years in 1979-1980. The highest rate (69.7 cases per million person-years) was observed in 65- to 74-year-old men in 1979-1980. The incidence rate in Western Australia was greater than were the rates in other states of Australia after the mid 1960s. Pleural mesotheliomas accounted for 88\% of cases in which the site of the tumour was known; peritoneal mesotheliomas accounted for 10\% of such cases and "other" sites for 2\% of such cases. In 6\% of cases the site was not specified. The exposure to asbestos was stated as "definite" in 59\% of the cases with a recorded history of exposure: 8\% of all the cases in the study had been exposed to crocidolite (blue asbestos) from Wittenoom Gorge in Western Australia. The age at diagnosis of patients with known exposure to asbestos was similar to that in those without known exposure. The increases in the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in Australia follow the published trends in the production and use of the amphibole varieties of asbestos in this country after a lag period of between 20 and 30 years.}

AIMS: To present summary statistics of the British mesothelioma epidemic including summaries by occupation and geographical area. METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for local authorities, unitary authorities and counties. Temporal trends in SMRs were also examined. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using the Southampton (based on the 1980 standard occupational classification) coding scheme. Temporal trends in PMRs were also examined. RESULTS: The annual number of mesothelioma deaths has increased from 153 in 1968 to 1848 in 2001. Current deaths in males account for about 85\% of the cases. The areas of West Dunbartonshire (SMR 637), Barrow-in-Furness (593), Plymouth (396) and Portsmouth (388) have the highest SMRs over the period 1981-2000. The occupations with the highest PMRs are metal plate workers (PMR 503), vehicle body builders (526), plumbers and gas fitters (413) and carpenters (388). CONCLUSIONS: These data reinforce earlier findings that geographical areas and occupations associated with high exposure to asbestos in the past continue to drive the mesothelioma epidemic in Great Britain. However, the trends over time suggest a change in the balance of risk away from traditional asbestos exposure industries to industries where one could describe the exposure as secondary, such as plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters, and electricians.}

This approach is designed to promote confidence in the community and among data custodians that there are benefits of linked health information being used and that individual privacy is being rigorously protected. BACKGROUND: Linked health administration data can provide an unparalleled resource for the monitoring and evaluation of health care services. However, for a number of reasons, these data have not been readily available to researchers. In Australia, an additional barrier to research is the result of health data sets being collected by different levels of government - thus all are not available to any one authority. To improve this situation, a practical blue-print for the conduct of data linkage is proposed. This should provide an approach suitable for most projects that draw large volumes of information from multiple sources, especially when this includes organisations in different jurisdictions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Health data, although widely and diligently collected, continue to be under-utilised for research and evaluation in most countries. This protocol aims to make these data more easily available to researchers by providing a controlled and secure mechanism that guarantees privacy protection.}

(ii) NSW Central Cancer Registry data for all males in NSW with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1988 and 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Number of PSA tests, age-standardised rates of PSA tests by State and Territory, and proportions of males who had a PSA test. (ii) Recorded incidence of prostate cancer in NSW. RESULTS: (i) More than 2.2 million PSA tests were done on more than 1.1 million Australians between 1989 and 1996. The annual number of males tested increased fivefold in this period and peaked in 1995. Twenty-seven per cent of Australian men aged 50 years or over had at least one PSA test in 1995 or 1996; 33\% of men aged 60-69 years had a test in this period. (ii) In NSW the number of PSA tests per quarter was highly correlated with the number of new cases of prostate cancer (R2 = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Although no organised program for prostate cancer screening exists, and despite repeated advice against it, opportunistic screening has been occurring at high rates. There was a high correlation between PSA testing and prostate cancer incidence between 1990 and 1995 in NSW.}

SUBJECTS: We used reimbursement claims for Medicare-eligible subjects diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1991 and 1999. Patients were grouped by initial treatment, with 17,846 receiving radical prostatectomy (RP), 25,933 receiving external beam radiotherapy (XRT), and 4525 receiving brachytherapy (BT). METHODS: Cancer-attributable costs were computed by subtracting noncancer costs from total Medicare reimbursements among newly diagnosed cancer patients. Noncancer costs were estimated in 2 ways: (1) average costs among age-matched, cancer-free control subjects (control method) and (2) projections based on claims from subjects before diagnosis (prediagnosis method). Adjusted annual percent change in cancer-attributable costs was calculated using multivariate generalized linear models. RESULTS: Noncancer costs increased at a much lower rate among men prior to diagnosis (3.8\% annually) than among the general Medicare population (10.9\%). The 2 approaches yielded different results; RP costs declined by 2.4\% annually (prediagnosis method) versus 6.2\% (control method); XRT costs declined by 1.5\% versus 5.8\%; and BT costs declined by 4.1\% versus 8.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: Because of self-selection of PSA screening, men diagnosed with prostate cancer today are now healthier overall than men in the general population and are considerably healthier than men diagnosed previously. Estimates of cancer-attributable costs that do not account for this healthy selection effect are likely to be biased. Declines in cancer-attributable treatment costs are evident even after accounting for a healthy screenee effect, suggesting that there has been a real reduction in cancer treatment costs.}

As a first step the method involves the fit of incidence data by an age, period and cohort model to derive incidence projections. Prevalence is then estimated from modelled incidence and survival estimates. Cancer mortality is derived as a third step from modelled incidence, prevalence and survival. An application to female breast cancer is given for the Connecticut State by using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR), 1973-1993. The age, period and cohort model fitted incidence quite well and allowed us to derive long-term projections up to 2030. Patients' survival was also projected to future years according to a scenario approach based on two extreme hypotheses: steady, that is, no more improvements after 1993 (conservative), and continuously improving at the same rate as during the observation period. Age-standardized estimated incidence shows a changing trend around the year 2005, when it starts decreasing. Age-standardized prevalence is expected to increase and change trend at a later date. Breast cancer mortality is projected as decreasing, as the combined result of no further increase in incidence and improving cancer patients' survival. An easy-to-use PIAMOD software package, on which work is in progress, will be made available to individual cancer registries and/or health planning institutions or authorities once it is developed. The use of the PIAMOD method for cancer registries will allow them to provide results of paramount importance for the whole community involved in the assessment of future disease burden scenarios in an evolving society.}

Three diseases were selected for analysis: lung cancer, emphysema, and chronic obstructive lung disease. During 1971-85 deaths that would previously have been certified under chronic bronchitis have increasingly tended to be classified under chronic airways obstruction. The definition of chronic obstructive lung disease that was used includes both terms to avoid the artificial decline caused by consideration of chronic bronchitis in isolation. Age specific rates for all three diseases show a pronounced cohort (period of birth) pattern, rates for men rising up to the rates for those born shortly after the turn of the century and then declining, and rates for women peaking in the cohort born 20-25 years later. For chronic obstructive lung disease, but not for lung cancer and emphysema, the cohort peak is superimposed on a sharply declining downward trend. In both sexes cohort patterns of cumulative cigarette consumption peak at a time broadly similar to those seen for the three diseases. Trends in cigarette consumption, however, cannot explain the underlying steeply declining rate of chronic obstructive lung disease. Nor can they fully explain the declining trends in lung cancer and emphysema rates in younger men and women.}

SETTING: Netherlands, University Hospital Groningen. PATIENTS: Included were 425 patients referred for lung transplantation, of whom 57 underwent transplantation. INTERVENTION: Lung transplantation. RESULTS: For the baseline scenario, the costs per life-year gained are G 194,000 (G=Netherlands guilders) and the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are G 167,000. Restricting patient inflow ("policy scenario") lowers the costs per life-year gained: G 172,000 (costs per QALY gained: G 144,000). The supply of more donor lungs could reduce the costs per life-year gained to G 159,000 (G 135,000 per QALY gained; G1 =US \$0.6, based on exchange rate at the time of the study). CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is an expensive but effective intervention: survival and quality of life improve substantially after transplantation. The costs per life-year gained are relatively high, compared with other interventions and other types of transplantation. Restricting the patient inflow and/or raising donor supply improves cost-effectiveness to some degree. Limiting the extent of inpatient screening or lower future costs of immunosuppressives may slightly improve the cost-effectiveness of the program.}

DESIGN: Observational study of HIV-infected individuals, both those treated with antiretroviral therapy and those untreated, enrolled in an ongoing prospective cohort (median follow-up, 5.3. years). SETTING: Sixteen HIV outpatient clinics throughout Italy. PATIENTS: A total of 1,078 individuals infected with HIV through injecting drug use or homo-/heterosexual activity, and with accurately estimated dates of seroconversion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND METHODS: Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of receiving antiretroviral therapy before AIDS. Crude and adjusted relative hazards of AIDS and of death from AIDS using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of beginning pre-AIDS antiretroviral therapy within 7 years of seroconversion was 49.2\%. Injecting drug users (IDU) were less likely to undergo antiretroviral treatment before AIDS than homosexual men and heterosexual contacts. The adjusted relative hazard of developing AIDS for patients treated with ZDV (relative hazard adjusted for occurrence of acute HIV disease, pre-AIDS HIV-related diseases, CD4 count, and use of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) was 0.57 within the first year of starting zidovudine and 0.92 after 1 year of therapy. Stratifying by HIV exposure category, the adjusted relative hazards of AIDS for individuals who started ZDV less and more than 1 year before AIDS were 0.74 and 0.99 among IDU, 0.31 and 0.89 among homosexual men, and 0.69 and 0.72 among heterosexuals, respectively. Similar results were obtained when using death from AIDS as an endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: IDU began pre-AIDS antiretroviral therapy significantly later than homosexual men and heterosexuals, even after adjusting for CD4 count. Results from this non-randomized study confirm that antiretroviral treatment has only a short-term clinical benefit. There was a stronger association between antiretroviral treatment and lower risk of AIDS in homosexual men than in IDU},

	annote = {Relative survival is frequently used in population-based studies as a method for estimating disease-related mortality without the need for information on cause of death. We propose an extension to relative survival of a flexible parametric model proposed by Royston and Parmar for censored survival data. The model provides smooth estimates of the relative survival and excess mortality rates by using restricted cubic splines on the log cumulative excess hazard scale. The approach has several advantages over some of the more standard relative survival models, which adopt a piecewise approach, the main being the ability to model time on a continuous scale, the survival and hazard functions are obtained analytically and it does not use split-time data.}

	annote = {OBJECTIVE: To look for surrogate markers in HIV-1 infection that can predict the decline of CD4+ T cells. METHODS: Multiparameter flow cytometric analyses of CD8+ lymphocytes were performed. These cells were investigated for their expression of the activation marker CD38+ within the naive (CD45RA+) and primed (CD45RO+) subsets. Serial CD4 counts were plotted for each patient and the straight line that best fitted was obtained using least squares regression. Differences in rate of decline were tested using analysis of variance, after each patient was weighted by the reciprocal of the variance. RESULTS: Baseline levels of percentages of CD8+CD38+ T lymphocytes predict the CD4 decline in HIV-1-infected patients. Within the CD8+ subset, the primed CD8+CD38+CD45RO+ population was responsible for this prediction. Conversely, the naive CD8+CD38+CD45RA+ population was not predictive. Patients who initially showed a percentage of CD8+CD38+ T lymphocytes above the median ({\textgreater} 25\%) had a more marked decline in CD4+ T cells when compared to individuals with percentages of CD8+CD38+ T lymphocytes below the median value (79.3 and 21.2 x 10(6)/l mean CD4 cell decline per year, respectively). Similarly, percentages of CD8+CD38+CD45RO+ T cells above the median value ({\textgreater} 7\%) were also associated with a more rapid decline (69.4 and 14.2 x 10(6)/l mean CD4+ cell decline per year). These results were statistically significant after adjustment for the baseline CD4 count and beta 2-microglobulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Percentages of activated CD8+ cells expressing CD38+ can predict the rate of decline (slope) of the CD4+ T cells. This resides in the CD45RO+ primed population. An early prediction of the CD4+ slope will allow the clinician to target treatment to those patients that are most likely to benefit},

For 66 DMM, 149 KK and 107 PK a risk from asbestos fibre dust at the workplace was not detectable. For latter persons indoor and outdoor asbestos exposure outside of the workplace were investigated. The following factors were examined: neighbourhood exposure from companies using asbestos, living in big cities and nearby main traffic roads, building materials containing asbestos, electric storage heaters and household contacts. For using electric storage heaters a statistically significant increased odds ratio (OR) was observed for DMM as well in comparison with KK (OR = 2.42; 95\%-CI: 1.01-5.72) and in comparison for PK (OR = 2.91; 95\%-CI: 1.08-7.80). Only outside of Hamburg an increased OR compared to KK was observed for people living in the neighbourhood of asbestos factories (OR = 16.3; 95\%-CI: 1.35-196.8) and also, but only in Hamburg, compared to PK living nearby main traffic roads. There is only a trend for a mesothelioma-risk for household-contacts based on a few cases. In one DMM-patient without an occupational asbestos exposure the lung dust fibre analysis yielded 2.912 FB and 1.459 x 10(3) crocydolithe fibres per gram dried lung tissue. As a child he lived in the immediate vicinity of the blue asbestos mine in Wittenoom, Australia. Therefore in special cases a para-occupational asbestos or a neighbourhood asbestos exposure can be demonstrated as a risk factor of diffuse malignant mesothelioma.}

Here, we present an assessment of the current approaches used for the evaluation of chemically reactive metabolites. We also describe how these approaches are being used within the pharmaceutical industry to assess and minimize the potential of drug candidates to cause toxicity. At early stages of drug discovery, iteration between medicinal chemistry and drug metabolism can eliminate perceived reactive metabolite-mediated chemical liabilities without compromising pharmacological activity or the need for extensive safety evaluation beyond standard practices. In the future, reactive metabolite evaluation may also be useful during clinical development for improving clinical risk assessment and risk management. Currently, there remains a huge gap in our understanding of the basic mechanisms that underlie chemical stress-mediated adverse reactions in humans. This Review summarizes our views on this complex topic, and includes insights into practices considered by the pharmaceutical industry.}

To plan an appropriate response to heroin use in Australia, good estimates are needed of the numbers of dependent heroin users, the group who are most in need of treatment, most at risk of fatal opioid overdose and most at risk of contracting and transmitting blood-borne viruses. METHODS. Back-projection methods were used to estimate the numbers of people starting dependent heroin injecting in Australia between 1960 and 1997. Separate analyses were based on national opioid overdose deaths and numbers of new entrants to methadone treatment in New South Wales (NSW). Estimates of the rates at which dependent heroin users cease heroin use, commence methadone treatment or die from opioid overdoses were estimated from external data sources. RESULTS. Back- projection estimates derived from opioid overdose deaths indicated that there were 104 000 (lower limit of 72 000 and upper limit of 157 000) people who were heroin dependent in Australia between 1960 and 1997. Of these it was estimated that 67 000 (39 000-120 000) were still heroin dependent at the end of 1997. Back-projection estimates based on numbers of new entrants to methadone treatment in NSW indicated that there were 108 000 (82 000-141 000) heroin-dependent people in Australia between 1960 and 1997, of whom 71 000 (47 000-109 000) were estimated to be heroin dependent at the end of 1997. Both analyses indicated that the number of heroin-dependent people in Australia has increased substantially from the early 1970s onwards. CONCLUSIONS. Back- projection estimates based on analyses of treatment entries and opioid overdose deaths provide an additional method for estimating the numbers of heroin-dependent people in the population. The addition of these methods to existing methods, using different data sources and statistical methods, should improve consensus estimates of the numbers of heroin-dependent people},

We discuss the use of this model when the temporal variations are due to purely secular (period) influences and when they are attributable to generational (cohort) influences. Finally we demonstrate the serious difficulties which attend the interpretation of regular trends. The methods described are illustrated by examples for incidence rates of bladder cancer in Birmingham, U.K., mortality from bladder cancer in Italy, and mortality from lung cancer in Belgium.}

The aim of this study was to describe changes in antiretroviral treatment and the way treatments were combined among 1806 patients with HIV seen at a single centre at the Royal Free Hospital, London, UK. DESIGN AND METHOD: Each calendar year was divided into quarters, and the number of patients receiving treatment and participating in clinical trials was determined. RESULTS: The proportion of patients on no therapy decreased from over 90\% at the beginning of 1988 to under 15\% at the end of 1997. Monotherapy was the only form of treatment available before 1992 but its use dropped to 2\% by the end of 1997. The standard of care at the end of 1997 was triple combination therapy, used in over 40\% of patients. There were dramatic changes in the use of individual agents; use of zidovudine decreased from 50\% during 1989 to 25\% during 1997, while use of lamivudine and stavudine saw an exponential rise in 1997. The protease inhibitors were used in equal proportions in this clinic population; the use of dual protease therapy began in 1997 and was rising rapidly by the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS: There have been major changes in the use of antiretroviral therapy at this centre, particularly during 1996 and 1997. The long-term cost implications and side-effects of intensive treatment regimens remain to be addressed},

In our study, both qualitative and quantitative density measurements were performed in a hospital-based group of premenopausal women before and after first full-term pregnancy providing an opportunity for direct evaluation of the effects of one pregnancy on MD. Mammograms were obtained from 23 women before and after first full-term pregnancy and from 28 nulliparous controls. MD was determined by a standard qualitative assessment method using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, and a quantitative computer-based threshold method (0-100\%). The mean age at mammography before and after pregnancy was 31 and 34 years, respectively, with a mean difference of 40 months between mammographies. The quantitative density assessment showed a significant reduction in relative MD after pregnancy of 12 percentage points (8.6-15.4), compared with 3.1 (0.0-6.2) in the nulliparous control group (P{\textless}0.001). A reduction in MD of more than 10\% was seen in 52\% of the patients, compared with 18\% of the controls. The qualitative density assessment confirmed a reduction in MD after pregnancy by one Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category (P=0.02). This longitudinal study showed that MD can be influenced by one full-term pregnancy. This effect was seen with both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. It may be hypothesized that breast cancer risk reduction associated with pregnancy is mediated through a direct reduction of MD, and MD assessment might be incorporated in individualizing risk assessment and prevention.},

The markers were measured regularly throughout follow-up in 224 patients. The risk of developing AIDS during follow-up was investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Time-updated values of the prognostic markers were used, which modelled the risk of AIDS according to the latest measurement of the marker rather than using a single value of the marker at baseline. During a median follow-up period of 13.6 months (range 0.5-31.9 months), 34 cases of AIDS occurred. In a univariate analysis, all three markers predicted the development of AIDS; a 10\% increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing CD38+ resulted in an 88\% increase in the risk of AIDS (95\% confidence interval: 53-130\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). After adjustment for the current CD4 count and beta2M, a 10\% increase in the CD8+,CD38+ population was associated with a 37\% increase in the risk of AIDS (95\% confidence interval: 4-81\%; p = 0.02). Thus, the percentage CD8+,CD38+ level predicts the development of AIDS independently of the latest CD4 count and beta2M. This assay is therefore potentially useful in conjunction with blood CD4 counts and serum beta2M levels in patient management and clinical trial design}

METHODS: Suicide data for 1994-98 were used to investigate area-based gradients of SES for the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSED) (an overall measure of SES), the Index of Economic Resources (IER), and the Index of Education and Occupation (IEO), using Poisson regression models adjusting for age, country-of-birth and urban-rural residence. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, country-of-birth and urban-rural residence, significant increasing linear trends in suicide risk from high to low quintiles of SES were evident in males for the IRSED (an average multiplicative increase in suicide risk of 8\% per quintile), IER (9\% increase) and IEO (5\% increase). For females, there was no evident SES gradient for the IRSED after adjusting for age, country-of-birth and urban-rural residence, but a significant positive linear trend from high to low quintiles of SES was found for the IER (6\% increase per quintile). A significant decreasing linear trend (increasing suicide risk with increasing SES) was evident for the IEO (30\% per quintle). CONCLUSION: Male suicide is positively associated with all three measures of SES examined. Female suicide is significantly associated with the IER (positive association) and IEO (negative), and because of this is not associated with the overall measure of SES. These findings partly explain why female suicide has been found to be poorly correlated with area-based measures of SES. IMPLICATIONS: Specific components of area-based socio-economic status provide a clearer picture of socio-economic suicide differentials in Australian females, with implications for population-based preventive strategies.}

However, prevalence proportions estimated from Connecticut data may not be representative of the total US, particularly for racial/ethnic subgroups. The purpose of this study is to apply the modelling approach developed by Capocaccia and De Angelis to cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute to obtain more representative US site-specific cancer prevalence proportion estimates for white and black patients. METHODS: Incidence and relative survival were modelled and used to obtain estimated completeness indices of SEER prevalence proportions for all cancer sites combined, stomach, cervix uteri, skin melanomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, lung and bronchus, colon/rectum, female breast, and prostate. For validation purposes, modelled completeness indices were computed for Connecticut and compared with empirical completeness indices (the ratio of Connecticut based prevalence proportion estimates using 1973-1993 data to 1940-1993 data). The SEER-based modelled completeness indices were used to adjust SEER prevalence proportion estimates for white and black patients. RESULTS: Model validation showed that the adjusted SEER cancer prevalence proportions provided reasonably unbiased prevalence proportion estimates in general, although more complex modelling of the completeness indices is necessary for female cancers of the colon, melanoma, breast, cervix, and all cancers combined. The SEER-based cancer prevalence proportions are incomplete for most cancer sites, more so for women, whites, and at older ages. For all cancers combined, prevalence proportions tended to be higher for whites than blacks. For the site-specific cancers this was true for stomach, prostate, cervix uteri, and lung and bronchus (men only). For colon/rectal cancers the prevalence proportions were higher for blacks through ages 59 (men) and 64 (women), and then for the remaining ages they were higher for whites. Prevalence proportions were lowest for stomach cancer and highest for prostate and female breast cancers. Men experienced higher prevalence proportions than women for skin melanomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, lung and bronchus, and colon/rectal cancers. CONCLUSION: The modelling approach applied to SEER data generally provided reasonable estimates of cancer prevalence. These estimates are useful because they are more representative of cancer prevalence than previously obtained and reported in the US.}

Some studies have suggested that there is no clear association, whereas others have indicated a strong relationship. On the whole it appears that there is probably a link between air travel and venous thrombosis. However, the link is likely to be weak, mainly affecting passengers with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The available evidence is not adequate to allow quantification of the risk. There are insufficient scientific data on which to base specific recommendations for prevention, other than that leg exercise should be taken during travel. Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify prospectively the incidence of the condition and those at risk.}

We further investigate if having control at work modifies these associations.Methods: We used cross-sectional survey data from 2,248 employees aged 40-44 years living in two cities of south-eastern Australia. Logistic regressions were used to compare the associations between job insecurity and demands among those with short (1-3 days) or long-term ({\textgreater} 3 days) sickness absence with those who had no sickness absence in the last four weeks. The mediating effects of mental and physical health were assessed by evaluating changes in the magnitude of the association between these work conditions and sickness absence.Results: High job insecurity (OR=3.28; 95\% Cl 1.54-6.95) and high work demands (OR=1.62; 95\% Cl 1.13-2.30) were significantly associated with long-term, but not with short-term, sickness absence. These associations were unaffected by job control. Depression and anxiety explained 61\% of the association between high work demands and long-term sickness absence and 30\% of the association between job insecurity and long-term sickness absence.Conclusion: Difficult working conditions may reduce productivity by contributing to longer absences from work.Implications: Reforms intended to improve economic performance should address any potential health costs of insecurity or intensification, which could inadvertently decrease productivity, possibly through their impact on mental health.}

This is due to an initial lag effect, but also to a dilution effect that results from the accrual of comparable cases in both groups after the end of the screening period. In order to combat the potential loss of power when applying conventional analysis tools, specifically the logrank test, Aron and Prorok (International Journal of Epidemiology 15, 36-43), have advocated analyzing the mortality experience using only the subcohort of cases ascertained within a given time period. However, it is not clear how to select an appropriate case ascertainment point, since this will depend on aspects of the natural history of the disease process which are poorly identified. Aron and Prorok suggest choosing the case ascertainment point to be the point at which the cumulative number of cases in the control group first becomes equal to that in the intervention group, that is, the "catch-up time." In this paper, we undertake a thorough evaluation of the bias and power properties of the catch-up time method. We base our study on simulated data resembling the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York study cohort. We consider several models for postdiagnosis survival under the null hypothesis of no screening effect on mortality, and under the alternative hypothesis of an effect of screening. We show that the catch-up method can yield tests with sizeable bias. In the absence of detailed knowledge about the underlying disease process, we suggest some adaptive tests that maintain nominal size but have more attractive power properties than the standard logrank test.}

Gynecological screening was offered to 1542 elderly women in a primary care setting; 75\% of the women had not had regular prior screening and 25\% had never been screened. Half of these women chose to participate in our screening program. An overall prevalence rate of 13.5 per 1000 abnormal Papanicolaou smears (95\% confidence interval, 5.6 to 21.4) was noted in the group. Age, race, prior screening history, and abnormal gynecological symptoms failed to predict the women who would have abnormal Papanicolaou smears. Our results suggest that cervical cancer screening should continue beyond 65 years of age if women have not received regular prior screening.}

DESIGN: Twenty-one studies were reviewed, including reports and abstracts published from January 1986 to July 1990. Of these, five included a comparison group and had sufficient data for inclusion in the analysis. RESULTS: All five controlled studies reported a significant association between HIV infection and CN. One included women with both intraepithelial and invasive lesions; the other four considered women with intraepithelial lesions only. The summary odds ratio indicated that the odds of HIV-infected women having CN are 4.9 (95\% confidence interval, 3.0-8.2) times that of HIV-negative women. CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed to clarify etiological relationships and the role of human papillomavirus in the causal pathway of the observed association. Meanwhile, available data are sufficient to encourage regular Papanicolaou's smear screening of HIV-infected women, and HIV testing and counseling of women with CN considered at risk for HIV infection.}

We discuss methods for selecting candidate comparable case groups and confirming that they are in fact comparable.

Traditionally, survival curves have been derived for cohorts of patients diagnosed many years ago. Using data of the Finnish Cancer Registry, we provide an empirical assessment of the use of a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, for deriving more up-to-date survival curves. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We calculated 10-year relative survival curves actually observed for patients diagnosed with one of the 15 most common forms of cancer in 1983 to 1987, and we compared them with the most up-to-date 10-year relative survival curves that might have been obtained in 1983 to 1987 using either traditional (cohort-wise) or period analysis. We also give the most recent 10-year survival curves obtained by period analysis for the 1993 to 1997 period. RESULTS: For all forms of cancer, period analysis of the 1983 to 1987 data yielded survival curves that were very close to the survival curves later observed for patients who were newly diagnosed in that period (median and maximum difference of 10-year relative survival estimates: 0.9 and 5.7 percent units, respectively). By contrast, the survival curves obtained by traditional (cohort-wise) survival analysis in 1983 to 1987 would have been much lower for most forms of cancer (median and maximum difference: 5.8 and 18.4 percent units, respectively). The 10-year survival curves for the 1993 to 1997 period are substantially more favorable than previously available, traditionally derived survival curves for most forms of cancer. CONCLUSION: Period analysis is a useful tool for deriving up-to-date long-term survival curves of patients with cancer.}

Thus, mortality data coded using ICD-10 can be a valid source for mesothelioma surveillance and can be instituted without major cost if a national mortality statistics program based on ICD-10 is in place, making it feasible even for developing countries.}

The study of mortality patterns and the forecasting of future mortality with its associated impacts on social welfare. health care, and societal planning has become a more pressing issue. An ideal set of data to study Patterns of change in long-term mortality is the well-known historical Swedish cohort mortality data. because of its high quality and long span of more than two Centuries. We explore the use of functional data analysis to model these data and to derive mortality forecasts. Specifically, we address the challenge of flexibly modeling these data while including, the effect of the birth year by regarding log-hazard functions, derived from observed cohort lifetable, as random functions. A functional model for the analysis of these cohort log-hazard functions, extending functional principal component approaches by introducing time-varying eigenfunctions, is found to adequately address these challenges. The associated analysis of the dependency Structure of the cohort log-hazard functions leads to the concept of time-varying principal components of mortality. We then extend this analysis to mortality forecasting, by combining prediction of incompletely, observed log-hazard functions with functional local extrapolation, and demonstrate these functional approaches for the Swedish cohort mortality data.},

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched PubMed (November 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Eight eligible trials were identified. We excluded a biased trial and included 600,000 women in the analyses. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95\% CI 0.67 to 0.83). The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95\% CI 0.74 to 0.87). We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.03).Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.42) for the two adequately randomised trials that measured this outcome; the use of radiotherapy was similarly increased. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Screening is likely to reduce breast cancer mortality. As the effect was lowest in the adequately randomised trials, a reasonable estimate is a 15\% reduction corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 0.05\%. Screening led to 30\% overdiagnosis and overtreatment, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5\%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. To help ensure that the women are fully informed of both benefits and harms before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk.},

METHOD: The effect of publishing interim analyses on the results of a typical HIV RCT comparing regimens of registered antiretroviral drugs was illustrated using a simulation study. Simulations modeled an RCT comparing the effect of two treatment combinations on changes in log HIV viral load from baseline. Publication of interim results at 6 months was assumed to lead to 50\% of patients switching from the poorer treatment if interim results were statistically significant (p {\textless}.05), 20\% of patients switching from the poorer treatment if interim results were marginally significant (.05 {\textless} p {\textless}.20), and 10\% of all patients switching treatment if interim results were not statistically significant. Three scenarios were simulated: a large treatment difference (0.4 log HIV viral load), a moderate difference (0.2 log), and no treatment difference (0.0 log). RESULTS: The simulation study showed that if the true treatment difference was large (0.4 log) the power of the trial was reduced from over 80\% at 6 months to under 37\% at 12 months. Furthermore, given the statistical significance of the interim analysis results at 6 months, the simulations illustrated that the trial results would appear similar at 12 months, regardless of the true underlying treatment difference. CONCLUSION: The simulations reinforce the fact that publication of interim analyses of RCTs can affect the future conduct of a trial and make interpretation of final results difficult},

The overall evidence, predominantly relating to women, indicates a weak association with the husband's smoking and many reviewers have concluded that this demonstrates a causal effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Interpreting weak associations is notoriously difficult, however, and this paper reviews problems specific to the ETS-lung cancer relationship. After describing how to select relevant studies and appropriate data, the methods for combining evidence together ('meta-analysis') are discussed, and the need to investigate sources of heterogeneity is emphasized. Separate consideration is given to various forms of bias that may affect overall relative risk estimates, including misclassification of active smoking status, confounding, systematic case-control differences, recall bias, diagnostic bias and publication bias. Sections on dose-response, multiple ETS exposure sources and other issues follow. The problems are illustrated from the available literature. It is shown there is no significant association of lung cancer with workplace, childhood or social ETS exposure or with smoking by the wife. Though statistically significant, the association with husband's smoking is weak and heterogeneous and varies widely according to various study characteristics. The association is markedly weakened by the adjustment for smoking misclassification bias and is likely to be affected by confounding and other sources of bias. While the precise extent of all the biases remains unclear, it seems impossible to conclude with any certainty that ETS causes lung cancer.}

RESULTS: In 10/12 interrupter patients a rebound of HIV-1 RNA was detected in all three structured treatment interruptions (STI). Plasma virus doubling time was shorter during the first STI than in the second and third STI, corresponding to an average 13\% reduction in viral basic reproductive rate. However, the mean time before plasma viral load rose to {\textgreater} 50 copies/ml was significantly shorter in the second and third STI. The average frequency of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in the interrupter patients at the end of the third STI cycle was significantly higher compared with the baseline and the end of the first STI. A substantial increase in HIV-specific CD8 T cell frequencies was found in four interrupter patients, whereas there were no changes in all 14 non-interrupter individuals. A weak p24-specific T helper response developed in 5/12 interrupter patients compared with no response in non-interruptors, but these responses were transient and disappeared rapidly. CONCLUSION: The increase in the control of viral replication, and positive effects of STI on immune responses in this population should encourage the further development of HIV-specific immune-based therapeutic strategies.}

Compared to passive collection, salivettes reduced the concentration of cortisol (p=.001) and sIgA (p=.002). Eyespears did not reduce cortisol or sIgA concentration, and showed less interference in the rank ordering of cortisol (r(eyespear with passive) =.90) and sIgA scores (r(eyespear with passive)=.96) compared to salivettes (r cortisol(salivette with passive)=.79; r sIgA(salivette with passive)=.66). The comfort and acceptability of both cotton-based devices were rated positively. Cotton-cellulose eyespears could offer methodological advantages for collecting saliva to measure cortisol and sIgA levels, and, because they can be held during sampling, may be useful for research with children and the frail elderly.

We compared the efficiency of cervical cancer-screening programs by performing a cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer-screening policies from high-income countries. METHODS: We used the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) program to model and determine the costs and effects of almost 500 screening policies, some fictitious and some actual (i.e., recommended by national guidelines). The costs (in U.S. dollars) and effects (in years of life gained) were compared for each policy to identify the most efficient policies. RESULTS: There were 15 efficient screening policies (i.e., no alternative policy exists that results in more life-years gained for lower costs). For these policies, which considered two to 40 total scheduled examinations, the age range expanded gradually from 40-52 years to 20-80 years as the screening interval decreased from 12 to 1.5 years. For the efficient policies, the predicted gain in life expectancy ranged from 11.6 to 32.4 days, compared with a gain of 46 days if cervical cancer mortality were eliminated entirely. The average cost-effectiveness ratios increased from \$6700 (for the longest screening interval) to \$23 900 per life-year gained. For some countries, the recommended screening policies were close to efficient, but the cost-effectiveness could be improved by reducing the number of scheduled examinations, starting them at later ages, or lengthening the screening interval. CONCLUSIONS: The basis for the diversity in the screening policies among high-income countries does not appear to relate to the screening policies' cost-effectiveness ratios, which are highly sensitive to the number of Pap smears offered during a lifetime.}

METHODS: Seroconversion dates were calculated for each subject using a cohort-specific estimate of the cumulative HIV seroincidence over calendar time. In survival analysis, we studied the progression from seroconversion to AIDS and death by risk group. We compared non-progression between both risk groups by evaluating annual CD4 decline over the 7 years following seroconversion among AIDS-free subjects. RESULTS: The relative hazard (RH) of AIDS for homosexual men compared with IDU was 1.54 before, and 1.21 after, adjusting for age at seroconversion and year of seroconversion. The risk of death from any cause for homosexual men compared with IDU increased over time since seroconversion. Fifty IDU died prior to AIDS, compared with seven homosexual men (unadjusted RH for homosexual men 0.10). Ignoring this pre-AIDS mortality, the crude RH of death for homosexual men compared with IDU was 2.05. Alter adjusting for age at seroconversion and year of seroconversion in multivariate analysis, the RH became 1.42. No differences in progression between subgroups aged 24 years or older could be demonstrated, but subjects {\textless} 24 years were found to be at a decreased risk. Proportions of non-progressors based on CD4 slope {\textgreater} or = 0 at 7 years following seroconversion were higher for IDU than for homosexual men. No differences were found in the proportion (approximately 5\%) classified as non-progressors by criteria of both slope {\textgreater} or = 0 and absolute CD4 counts {\textgreater} 500 cells x 10(6)/l, even if pre-AIDS deaths and losses to follow-up were included. CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence for an effect of risk group on progression and non-progression. Pre-AIDS mortality was much higher among IDU than homosexual men. Pre-AIDS mortality and a nonlinear age effect should be considered in planning interventions as well as studies comparing risk groups and modelling the epidemic.}

METHODS: After pulmonary rehabilitation, 1218 patients at 17 medical centers were randomly assigned to lung-volume-reduction surgery or continued medical treatment. Costs for the use of medical care, medications, transportation, and time spent receiving treatment were derived from Medicare claims and data from the trial. Cost effectiveness was calculated over the duration of the trial and was estimated for 10 years of follow-up with the use of modeling based on observed trends in survival, cost, and quality of life. RESULTS: Interim analyses identified a group of patients with excess mortality and little chance of improved functional status after surgery. When these patients were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratio for lung-volume-reduction surgery as compared with medical therapy was 190,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 53,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 10 years. Subgroup analyses identified patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity after pulmonary rehabilitation who had lower mortality and better functional status than patients who received medical therapy. The cost-effectiveness ratio in this subgroup was 98,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 21,000 dollars at 10 years. Bootstrap analysis revealed substantial uncertainty for the subgroup and 10-year estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Given its cost and benefits over three years of follow-up, lung-volume-reduction surgery is costly relative to medical therapy. Although the predictions are subject to substantial uncertainty, the procedure may be cost effective if benefits can be maintained over time.}

Defects within the CD45RA+ ('unprimed') and CD45R0+ ('primed') T-cell populations were also investigated. METHODS: Quantitative immunofluorescence and double and triple labelling in flow cytometry were performed for (1) CD25 (IL-2 receptor alpha chain) expression, (2) lymphocyte and T-cell survival, and (3) blast transformation and proliferation--in relation to the original input of cells for each subpopulation. RESULTS: T cells from normal and HIV-1-seropositive donors were CD25+ at day 1.

Cells from HIV-1-seropositive donors showed poor blast responses when co-cultured with HIV-1-seronegative cells; both CD4 and CD8 cells were handicapped. In asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive people T cells with the CD45R0+ RA- ('primed') phenotype were three to five times more vulnerable to AALD than the CD45RA+ RO- ('unprimed') cells. In patients in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) disease stage IV both CD45R0+ and -RA+ populations were severely affected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first quantitative analysis to demonstrate that in HIV-1 infection mitogen-stimulated CD45R0+ ('primed') T cells preferentially die upon activation. Both the CD4 and CD8 lineages are affected, as seen in animal models of graft versus host disease. AALD may explain defects of immunological memory. The analysis of AALD may be a suitable assay for studying whether antiviral drugs influence the proliferative responses of lymphocytes},

In order to obtain such data in a comparable way a systematic evaluation of cancer prevalence in Europe was undertaken within the EUROPREVAL project. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standardised data were collected from 38 population-based registries on almost 3 million cancer patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1992. The prevalence of 11 specific cancer types was estimated at the index date of 31 December 1992. This study deals with the northern countries Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. RESULTS: There were large differences between these countries, Sweden having the highest prevalence rate of 3050 per 100 000 and Estonia the lowest, 1339 per 100 000. This difference is mainly due to a high proportion of cancers with favourable prognosis such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma, better survival and longer life expectancy in Sweden, whereas Estonia has a higher proportion of stomach and lung cancer with poor prognosis, worse survival and much shorter life expectancy, especially for males. For most tumour types, the Nordic countries did better than Estonia. There are indications that cancer patients in Estonia, as well as in Denmark, have a more advanced stage at diagnosis and that the Estonian health-care system is less efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Despite many similarities and a common historical background, the northern countries in Europe that participated in the EUROPREVAL study display quite different cancer patterns and prevalence. Reasons for these variations are discussed.}

Further linkage identified the offspring of the patient and sibling cohorts. The relative probabilities of parenthood for first and second births separately were estimated for male and female survivors in different diagnostic age-groups and subsites using a Cox proportional hazards model, with age as the time variable and adjusting for the birth cohort of parents. In addition, estimates were calculated for 5 diagnostic eras in all subsites combined. Compared to siblings, both female and male cancer survivors were less likely to parent at least 1 child (RR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.44-0.48 and RR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.54-0.60, respectively). The relative probability of parenthood was especially low in male childhood cancer survivors and female young adult cancer survivors. However, cancer patients were only slightly less likely than siblings to parent a second child, with RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.86-0.97 and RR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.89-1.01 for females and males, respectively. The relative probability of parenthood increased over calendar time among young adult cancer patients. The relative probability of parenthood following early onset cancer was overall significantly reduced by approximately 50\%. Parenting a second child, however, was not reduced among pediatric and adolescent survivors, and only slightly reduced among early adulthood cancer survivors compared to siblings.

METHODS: We prospectively studied 33 patients with primary HIV-1 infection for HIV-specific activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes and compared these lymphocyte responses with changes in viral load and clinical status over the subsequent 18 to 24 months. RESULTS: Soon after infection, activated HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, mediated primarily by CD8+ cells, were detected in 17 of 23 patients (74 percent). Memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes were found in 6 of 6 patients tested (100 percent) during the first three months of infection and in 17 of 21 patients (81 percent) tested during the first six months. The frequencies of memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes varied markedly over time, but overall they declined over the first 6 to 8 months and then stabilized over the next 12 to 18 months. The patients with higher frequencies of Env-specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes had a median level of plasma HIV-1 RNA about one third that of the patients with lower frequencies, (median number of RNA copies per milliliter, 22,000 vs. 62,000; P=0.006). Patients with low frequencies of Env-specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (or none) in early infection had a more rapid decline to less than 300 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In early HIV-1 infection, the induction of memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes, particularly those specific for Env, helps control viral replication and is associated with slower declines in CD4+ cell counts. Host cytolytic effector responses appear to delay the progression of HIV-1 disease.}

METHOD: Aggregate suicide data were examined after controlling for age and period using descriptive statistics and Poisson regression modelling. Three approaches were applied to address the non-identification of age, period and cohort in age-period-cohort (APC) models of suicide. RESULTS: Apparent cohort effects in male and female suicide using a minimum constraints APC model of age, period and cohort were no longer present in female suicide when a surrogate period APC model was used, and were absent in both male and female suicide when identifiable cohort effects were isolated using a 'drift' adjusted approach to APC modelling. CONCLUSION: Increases in youth suicide rates in NSW occurring since the 1960s cannot be attributed to cohort effects, such as family influences on development. The causes of youth suicide are thus effects operating contemporaneously.}

In 1992, all subjects who should be traced were sent a questionnaire. Exposure levels were estimated from results of periodic environmental surveys and duration of residence. Incidence rates were standardized to the World Population and Cox Regression was used to estimate the effects of exposure on incidence. To the end of 1993, 27 cases of mesothelioma were diagnosed. Mesothelioma cases stayed longer at Wittenoom, had a higher average intensity of exposure, and a higher cumulative exposure to crocidolite than control subjects. The standardized incidence of mesothelioma was 260 per million person-years, and was similar for males and females. The rate increased significantly with time from first exposure, duration of exposure and cumulative exposure. At these levels of crocidolite exposure, there is a significantly increased risk of mesothelioma, which is dose-dependent.}

Despite its high morbidity and mortality, the etiology of prostate cancer remains obscure. Although compelling laboratory data suggest a role for androgens in prostate carcinogenesis, most epidemiologic data, including serological and genetic studies, are inconclusive. In this chapter, we review the status of serologic studies and discuss the importance of intra-prostatic hormone levels in possibly clarifying the often-contradictory data on serologic studies. To provide insights and directions for epidemiologic research on hormones and prostate cancer, this review centers on the molecular epidemiology of hormone-related genetic loci. These loci have been investigated in a number of studies to date and will undoubtedly expand even further as rich new genetic information sources and high-throughput genotyping and analysis methods become available. Due to the enormous number of these loci, we recommend careful analysis and cautious interpretation of studies of genetic markers, including microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as false positive and negative results are likely due to limited statistical power, multiple hypothesis testing, population stratification, or non-representative population sampling. This review also highlights the need for replication in various populations, as well as reasons for performing functional analyses of SNPs, a critical and often under-appreciated component of molecular epidemiologic investigations. The time is ripe for concerted, large-scale multidisciplinary investigations that incorporate molecular genetics, biochemistry, histopathology, and endocrinology into traditional epidemiologic studies. Such collaboration will lead to a deeper understanding of the etiologic pathways of prostate cancer, ultimately yielding better preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The complement of the cancer mortality to incidence ratio [1-(M/I)] has been suggested as a valid proxy for 5-year relative survival. Whether this suggestion holds true for all types of cancer has not yet been adequately evaluated.
METHODS: We used publicly available databases of cancer incidence, cancer mortality and relative survival to correlate relative survival estimates and 1-(M/I) estimates from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the USA and the Netherlands. We visually examined for which tumour sites 5-year relative survival cannot simply be predicted by the 1-(M/I) and evaluated similarities between countries.
RESULTS: Country-specific linear regression analyses show that there is no systematic bias in predicting 5-year relative survival by 1-(M/I) in five countries. There is a small but significant systematic underestimation of survival from prognostically poor tumour sites in two countries. Furthermore, the 1-(M/I) overestimates survival from oral cavity and liver cancer with {\textgreater}10\% in at least two of the seven countries. By contrast, the proxy underestimates survival from soft tissue, bone, breast, prostate and oesophageal cancer, multiple myeloma and leukaemia with {\textgreater}10\% in at least two of the seven countries.
CONCLUSION: The 1-(M/I) is a good approximation of the 5-year relative survival for most but not all tumour sites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The recent advances in genomic research have made it possible to identify several new genomic-based biomarkers for prostate cancer. In this review we evaluate these new markers and speculate about future scenarios.


RESULTS

Today 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and independently validated to associate with prostate cancer. These SNPs are common in the population ({\textgreater}5\%) but the effect of these SNPs in these regions on prostate cancer risk is modest with odds ratios typically ranging between 1.1 and 1.3. It is estimated that these markers explain 25\% of the familial risk of prostate cancer. However, it is anticipated that additional 50-75 prostate cancer SNPs will be identified in the near future. The SNPs associated with prostate cancer so far are not associated with disease stage or outcome. There are several efforts to identify germline genetic markers that can be used as prognostic markers. There are also tumor-based methods that are promising in identifying new genetic markers that can be easily measured in plasma or urine.


CONCLUSION

There are several new "genetic" markers that in the near future might be used in clinical routine. These markers are easy to measure and stable over time. However the challenge is not only to identify new biomarkers but the real test is to validate new biomarkers in several large well-characterized patient populations. This validation must be done together will all other known biomarkers at the same time as it not likely that one single marker is enough, but a panel of different markers. Today 2010 there are over 19 000 publications in the area of biomarkers and prostate cancer, but only one biomarker, PSA, is used in the clinic today!},

Viral loads were measured on annual stored serum samples in 107 men with hemophilia A using the Roche Amplicor Monitor assay with non-B primers. On average, HIV-1 RNA levels increased significantly by 0.11 log10 per year over the course of HIV infection. This rate of increase was significantly faster in those who developed AIDS or died over the subsequent 12 to 17 year period, and in those who were older at HIV- 1 seroconversion. The risk of developing AIDS and death remained low when the HIV-1 RNA level was below 4 log10 copies/ml, but increased rapidly thereafter, supporting current guidelines for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy after the viral load has exceeded this level},

Population characteristics and rates of delivery of these preventive services are compared for low-income users of community health clinics vs private doctors' offices/HMOs. Three nationally representative data-files from the National Health Interview Survey--the Person-Level File, Sample Adult File, and Sample Adult Prevention File--were linked to obtain the necessary data on preventive services use in the 12,024 persons over age 50. Among the population of persons over age 50 living below 200\% of the poverty threshold, those using community clinics were more likely to be younger, a racial or ethnic minority, less formally educated, in poorer health, uninsured, and more likely to face time, transportation or cost barriers to obtaining health care (p {\textless} .01 for all comparisons), than their counterparts using private doctors' offices/HMOs. Community health clinics performed as well as private doctors/HMOs in the delivery of cancer screening, cholesterol screening and immunizations to lower income persons over 50 years. Rates of counseling about diet and exercise were higher among users of private doctor's offices than among users of community health clinics users (40\% vs. 31\% respectively, p = .02). Despite the severe resource constraints under which they operate, and the greater vulnerability of the population they serve, community clinics deliver preventive services at rates comparable to private doctors' offices and HMOs.}

Four hundred and ninety-five surgical complications occurred in 379 children (19.8 percent). Patients with inoperable tumors, bilateral renal tumors, peroperative therapy and those who refused treatment were excluded from this review. The most common complication was intestinal obstruction, which occurred in 132 patients (6.9 percent). This was followed by extensive intraoperative hemorrhage (112 patients), defined as blood loss exceeding 50 milliliters per kilogram of body weight. Intraoperative injuries to other visceral organs (including intestine, liver and spleen) occurred in 21 children and extensive vascular injuries were reported in 27 patients. There were nine deaths attributed to surgical complications (0.5 percent), only one of which was intraoperative. Survival of patients with complications was similar to patients without complications when stratified by histologic study and stage. Factors associated with the development of surgical complications included advanced local tumor stage at diagnosis, intravascular tumor extension and resection of other visceral organs at the time of nephrectomy. Complete removal of the tumor is important, but not at the expense of radical removal of adjacent structures, because of gross appearances at operation. They are often not invaded by the tumor, but rather are compressed, distorted or adherent without tumor infiltration. Identification of these groups will aid the surgeon in choosing the appropriate management for these patients at high risk. When initial exploration and precise surgical staging indicate that only a formidable operation will achieve total excision, shrinkage of the tumor with selective use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, may facilitate removal and decrease surgical morbidity. Preoperative therapy may also be the preferred approach for children with extensive intravascular tumor.}

These studies can be confounded by treatment patterns or influenced by choice of outcome and time horizon. Interpretation can be complicated by uncertainty about when mortality differences might be expected. The authors examined these issues in an ecologic analysis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and prostate cancer mortality across nine cancer registries in the United States. Results suggested a weak trend for areas with greater PSA screening rates to have greater declines in prostate cancer mortality; however, the magnitude of this trend varied considerably with the time horizon and outcome measure. A computer model was used to determine whether divergence of mortality declines would be expected under an assumption of a clinically significant survival benefit due to screening. Given a mean lead time of 5 years, the model projected that differences in mortality between high- and low-use areas should be apparent by 1999 in the absence of other factors affecting mortality. The authors concluded that modest differences in PSA screening rates across areas, together with additional sources of variation, could have produced a negative ecologic result. Ecologic analyses of the effectiveness of PSA testing should be interpreted with caution.}

In a multivariate model which adjusted for demographic factors and treatment, the most recent measurements of B2M (relative hazard (RH) 1.37 per g/l higher) and CD4 count (RH 2.17 per log-unit lower) were both significantly associated with the development of AIDS. Similarly, in a multivariate model which additionally adjusted for the development of AIDS as a time dependent covariate, there was a strong relationship with risk of death for the most recent measurements of B2M (RH 1.34 per g/l higher), and CD4 lymphocyte count (RH 1.91 per log-unit lower). A difference in the level of B2M could be used among patients with similar CD4 counts as an indicator of increased risk of progression to AIDS or death. Using the most recent values of these markers provides a better estimate of the risk of AIDS or death, compared to the more common method of analysis, where baseline values of the markers are used},

RESULTS: Mortality from causes other than breast cancer as a percentage of all-cause mortality is smallest for women in their forties and fifties, as small as 85\% of the all-cause rate, although the level and percentage of the impact varies by birth cohort. CONCLUSION: This method produces life tables by birth cohort and by age that are easily included as a common input by the various CISNET modeling groups to predict mortality from other causes. Attention to removing breast cancer mortality from all-cause mortality is worthwhile, because breast cancer mortality can be as high as 15\% at some ages.},

To address this question, Connecticut cancer incidence rates for the years 1940-79 were fitted to the model: Log (incidence rate) = constant + age effect + period effect + birth cohort effect + error term. Data for each cancer site and sex were categorized into 10-year intervals by time period and age group. Significance testing for the curvilinear effects (which are estimable functions) of age (A), period (P), and cohort (C) in the 44 data sets led to no clear choice of model for three data sets; an APC model for 20, an AP model for 7, and an AC model for 14. These choices were corroborated by the RA2 index. Limitations in the interpretation of the results were enumerated. Presentation of population-based cancer rates by implicitly assuming an AP model is valuable (e.g., for studying age distribution in different regions or for age-adjustment in examining international variation or time trends). However, the assumption of an AP model may often be incorrect, as was shown to be the case for most of these 44 data sets. The implications for monitoring trends and generating etiologic hypotheses were discussed in light of the results for cutaneous malignant melanoma and cancers of the cervix, breast, ovary, lung, and bladder.}

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical postprocessing method for forecast ensembles that generates calibrated probabilistic forecast products for weather quantities at individual sites. This paper introduces the spatial BMA technique, which combines BMA and the geostatistical output perturbation (GOP) method, and extends BMA to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts of whole weather fields simultaneously, rather than just weather events at individual locations. At any site individually, spatial BMA reduces to the original BMA technique. The spatial BMA method provides statistical ensembles of weather field forecasts that take the spatial structure of observed fields into account and honor the flow-dependent information contained in the dynamical ensemble. The members of the spatial BMA ensemble are obtained by dressing the weather field forecasts from the dynamical ensemble with simulated spatially correlated error fields, in proportions that correspond to the BMA weights for the member models in the dynamical ensemble. Statistical ensembles of any size can be generated at minimal computational cost. The spatial BMA technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature over the Pacific Northwest in 2004, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. The spatial BMA ensemble generally outperformed the BMA and GOP ensembles and showed much better verification results than the raw ensemble, both at individual sites, for weather field forecasts, and for forecasts of composite quantities, such as average temperature in National Weather Service forecast zones and minimum temperature along the Interstate 90 Mountains to Sound Greenway.}

We propose a new estimation procedure based on binary indicators defined by the test result for a diseased subject exceeding various specified quantiles of the distribution of test results from non-diseased subjects with the same covariate values. This procedure is conceptually and computationally simplified relative to existing procedures. Simulation study results indicate that the approach has fairly high statistical efficiency.

The median values were compared between the SBBC and control groups, comprising age-, sex-, and transfusion-matched HIV-1-uninfected subjects; transfusion-acquired HIV-1-positive LTNPs; and sexually acquired HIV-1-positive LTNPs. Members of the SBBC not only had normal levels of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but had primed CD45RO+ CD4+ T lymphocytes at or above normal levels. Furthermore, these primed cells expressed markers suggesting recent exposure to specific antigen. SBBC members exhibited variable activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. In particular, SBBC members with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA had normal levels of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes.

Controversy regarding the use of phytotherapeutic agents in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia is significant. We analyzed all available clinical trial data of the Permixon preparation to determine its clinical efficacy compared with placebo. METHODS: All published clinical trial data on Permixon (11 randomized clinical trials and 2 open label trials), involving 2859 patients, were used. These trials were disparate in size (from 22 to 592 patients) and duration (from 21 to 180 days). Peak urinary flow rate and nocturia were the two common end points. The statistical analysis was based on a random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The average +/- SE placebo effect on the peak urinary flow rate was an increase of 0.51 +/- 0.51 mL/s. The estimated effect of Permixon was a further increase of 2.20 +/- 0.51 mL/s (P {\textless}0.001). Placebo was associated with a reduction in the mean number +/- SE of nocturnal urinations of 0.69 +/- 0.15. A further reduction of 0.50 +/- 0.01 episodes of urination (P {\textless}0.001) occurred that was attributable to Permixon. Some heterogeneity was found among the studies. Treatment duration did not appear to impact either of these effects. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of all available published trials of Permixon in the treatment of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia revealed a significant improvement in peak flow rate and reduction in nocturia greater than with placebo.}

Compared with analyses based on data through 1992, a slower decline was found in male cases immediately after a peak in 2000-2004, but no other notable changes in the time pattern were detected. Analysis confirmed that the annual number of male mesothelioma cases, which increased steeply from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, has leveled off in terms of both the age-adjusted rate and the absolute numbers of cases. After a peak of approximately 2,000 cases, a return to background levels is expected by 2055. The total projected number of male mesothelioma cases in 2003-2054 is approximately 71,000. The maximum lifetime risk for males, which occurs for the 1925-1929 birth cohort, is 1.8 x 10(-3). The age-adjusted rate for females is constant, as are the female lifetime mesothelioma risk across birth cohorts (3.6 x 10(-4)) and the annual risk (3.9 x 10(-6)). The time pattern of cases for females supports the existence of a threshold exposure for mesothelioma and a quantifiable background rate.}

Guidance regarding the choice of a screening interval that achieves a high level of case-finding, without being excessively costly, can be obtained from one or more of several study designs that examine the subsequent occurrence of cancer in persons who have had a negative screening test. However, each of these can potentially provide a misleading result, and so their limitations must be considered before using the data they generate to develop a rational rescreening policy.}

Also, as reported from southern and south-eastern Africa, there are relatively high incidence rates of cancers of the oesophagus, bladder and (in men) lung. The AIDS epidemic has given rise to a striking increase in incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (now the commonest cancer of African men), but there is not much evidence for an increase in incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphomas nor, although rates are very high, of cervical cancer.}

We aimed to assess changes over time in the incidence of ADIs overall and within CD4 lymphocyte count strata, the relationship with treatment and degree of immunodeficiency at diagnosis of ADIs. METHODS: We did a prospective observational multicentre study of over 7300 patients in 52 European HIV-1 outpatient clinics. Incidence rates per 100 patient-years of observation were calculated. FINDINGS: In total, we recorded 1667 new ADIs; the incidence of ADIs declined from 30.7 per 100 patient-years of observation during 1994 (95\% CI 28.0-33.4) to 2.5 per 100 patient-years of observation during 1998 (95\% CI 2.0-3.0, p{\textless}0.0001, test for trend). Median CD4 lymphocyte count at diagnosis of a new ADI increased from 28 cells/microL to 125 cells/microL between 1994 and 1998 (p{\textless}0.0001), yet a steep decline in the rate of ADIs was seen after stratification by latest CD4 lymphocyte count within each year ({\textless} or = 50, 51-200, and {\textgreater} 200 cells/microL). Patients on HAART had a lower rate of ADIs than patients not on this treatment within each CD4 lymphocyte count strata. The proportion of ADIs attributable to cytomegalovirus retinitis and Mycobacterium avium complex declined over time (p=0.0058 and 0.0022, respectively), whereas the proportion of diagnoses attributable to non-Hodgkin lymphoma has increased (p{\textless}0.0001). In 1994, less than 4\% of ADIs were non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in 1998 the proportion was almost 16\%. This condition has become one of the most common ADIs in patients on HAART. INTERPRETATION: Our findings lend support to the idea that treatment regimens can lower the incidence of ADIs. The immediate risk of an ADI for a given CD4 lymphocyte count has declined over time and is lower among patients on HAART. Long-term follow-up of patients on combination treatment is essential to monitor the incidence of new and emerging diagnoses},

	annote = {Relative survival methods permit separating the effects of prognostic factors on disease-related 'excess mortality' from their effects on other-causes 'natural mortality', even when individual causes of death are unknown. As in conventional 'crude' survival, accurate assessment of prognostic factors requires testing and possibly modeling of non-proportional effects and, for continuous covariates, of non-linear relationships with the hazard. We propose a flexible extension of the additive-hazards relative survival model, in which the observed all-causes mortality hazard is represented by a sum of disease-related 'excess' and natural mortality hazards. In our flexible model, the three functions representing (i) the baseline hazard for 'excess' mortality, (ii) the time-dependent effects, and (iii) for continuous covariates, non-linear effects, on the logarithm of this hazard, are all modeled by low-dimension cubic regression splines. Non-parametric likelihood ratio tests are proposed to test the time-dependent and non-linear effects. The accuracy of the estimated functions is evaluated in multivariable simulations. To illustrate the new insights offered by the proposed model, we apply it to re-assess the effects of patient age and of secular trends on disease-related mortality in colon cancer.

METHODS: Medicare claims data were linked with cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute. Data from a 5\% random sample of men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer were combined with data from prostate cancer cases diagnosed during the calendar period from 1991 to 1998. PSA tests conducted after a diagnosis of prostate cancer were excluded. RESULTS: PSA use has stabilized among white men, reaching an annual rate of 38\% by 1995 and remaining at this level through 1998. The annual rate of use among black men reached 31\% by 1998, but was still increasing at that time. By 1996, at least 80\% of tests in both blacks and whites were second or later tests. By the end of 1996, 35\% of white men and 25\% of black men were undergoing testing at least biannually or more frequently. In 1996, 83\% of diagnoses in whites and 77\% in blacks were preceded by a PSA test. CONCLUSIONS: Older black men lag slightly behind older white men in their use of the PSA test; however, annual testing rates in blacks have yet to stabilize. In both race groups, an overwhelming majority of diagnoses are associated with a PSA test, whether for screening or diagnostic purposes. Regular screening rates in blacks are substantially lower than in whites, but the regular screening rates are relatively low in both race groups. Should PSA screening prove efficacious, efforts to promote regular use among both black and white men will likely be needed.}

Relative risk estimates and the use of models developed for occupational situations do not provide good estimates of the relevance of environmental fibres in producing mesotheliomas in the general population. This may be the result of differences between the groups in their time periods of exposure and long-term elimination of asbestos from the lungs. The number of mesotheliomas that might be due to low-level environmental exposure to asbestos cannot be determined from lung contents alone, but an assessment based on detailed occupational histories from the Australian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program show that the problem is not one of great importance when compared with other public health issues.}

The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in the U.S. that actually were receiving care for their disease as a better quantification of the burden of CRC. METHODS: The authors used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program linked to Medicare claims. Four phases of CRC care were defined: initial diagnosis and treatment, postdiagnostic monitoring, treatment for recurrent/metastatic disease, and terminal care. CRC care prevalence measures by phase were extrapolated to the U.S. population age 65 years and older. RESULTS: For all patients with CRC who were diagnosed between 1975 and 1996, 62\% received at least 1 service related to their CRC in 1996, and patients received an average of 2.1 months per person of CRC care. Among the U.S. population age 65 years and older, 1.81\% had 1 diagnosis of CRC, and (1.81\% x 0.62\%) = 1.12\% received at least 1 service related to their CRC. This translated to 380,783 individuals who received care and 1,210,121 person months of care during 1996. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in which care prevalence has been estimated directly. The classification of CRC care by phases of care provides a very detailed picture of the amount of care delivered in the U.S. population. Person-month estimates can be used to estimate the cost of CRC.}

Mothers of 105 (60.3\%) cases and 828 (76.9\%) controls replied. Changes in marital status between the time of interview and the time of the postal questionnaire did not differ between mothers of cases and that of controls when adjusted for marital status at the time of death/nominated date for controls. Cases were more likely to have further children than controls (P {\textless} 0.001) and had them sooner after the death than after the nominated date for control babies (P {\textless} 0.001). Case mothers were more likely than controls to have a second child after the death/nominated date, however the interval between the first and second child after the death/nominated date was the same as that for controls. CONCLUSIONS: Although the death of an infant is a major stress on marital relationships, at approximately 3.7 years marital breakdown is no higher than in the control population. After the death of her baby the mother "replaces" the child by having more children than control mothers and having the first one earlier than control mothers. Mothers who lose a baby from SID are more fertile than the control population both before and after the death.}

Unique parameter estimates that avoid arbitrary constraints are provided by estimable functions of the parameter estimates. For data that are generated using equal interval widths for age and period, the identifiability issue may be expressed in terms of the age, period and cohort slopes. However, when the interval widths are not the same for age and period, additional identifiability problems arise. These may be represented in terms of macro-trends, which have the identical identifiability problem seen in the equal interval case, and micro-trends, which are the source of the additional problems. A framework for testing estimability is presented, and a variety of potentially interesting functions of the parameters considered. Unlike the equal interval case, drift is not estimable for unequal intervals, but local drift may be. In addition, the available functions for forecasting are much more restrictive in the latter case. This estimability problem induces cyclical patterns in the estimates of trend as is demonstrated using data on leukaemia in Connecticut males, but this can be avoided through the use of smoothing splines. These methods of are illustrated for three-year period and five-year age intervals using data on lung cancer mortality in Californian women.}

Odds ratios for prostate cancer, based on quartiles of serum hormone levels, were determined using conditional logistic regression methods. The odds ratios for the highest quartiles were 1.37 (95\% confidence interval, 0.73-2.55) for 3-alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and 1.24 (95\% confidence interval, 0.62-2.47) for androstenedione, but none of the differences was statistically significant.

The naive sample average of the observed costs from all study subjects or from the uncensored cases only can be severely biased, and the standard survival analysis techniques are not applicable. To minimize the bias induced by censoring, we partition the entire time period of interest into a number of small intervals and estimate the average total cost either by the sum of the Kaplan-Meier estimator for the probability of dying in each interval multiplied by the sample mean of the total costs from the observed deaths in that interval or by the sum of the Kaplan-Meier estimator for the probability of being alive at the start of each interval multiplied by an appropriate estimator for the average cost over the interval conditional on surviving to the start of the interval. The resultant estimators are consistent if censoring occurs solely at the boundaries of the intervals. In addition, the estimators are asymptotically normal with easily estimated variances. Extensive numerical studies show that the asymptotic approximations are adequate for practical use and the biases of the proposed estimators are small even when censoring may occur in the interiors of the intervals.

Using high-quality incidence data from 1973-1992 in nine population-based cancer registries (Alberta, Bombay, Denmark, Israel, New Zealand, Osaka, Oxford, Slovenia, Utah), we have examined past increases in specific lymphoid neoplasms. Further, by using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5-, 10- and 15-year projections for each group of lymphoid neoplasms. RESULTS: NHL incidence increased in all centers by an average of 77\% in men and 66\% in women between 1973 and 1992. Fifteen-year projections of these rates to 2003-2007 indicate that they will increase by an average of 55\% among men and 79\% among women. High projected incidence rates above 15/100,000 in men and 10/100,000 in women are expected in Alberta, Denmark, Israel, New Zealand, Oxford, and Utah by 2003-2007. The one notable exception was among men from Osaka, where no increase was projected. Modest increases in leukemia and multiple myeloma rates were observed in most of the nine registries with further projected increases by 2007. Projected incidence rates of Hodgkin's disease indicated little change. CONCLUSION: Increases in NHL rates are occurring worldwide and provide no evidence of peaking. A key assumption in the projected rates is that the effect of environmental agents determining the trends during 1973-1992 will remain stable during the subsequent projection period.}

The purpose of this study is to apply functional data analysis techniques to model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and forecast entire age-specific mortality functions using a state-space approach.We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in 5 year age groups (45 to 85+). We use functional data analysis techniques where mortality and incidence are modelled as curves with age as a functional covariate varying by time. Data are smoothed using non-parametric smoothing methods then decomposed (using principal components analysis) to estimate basis functions that represent the functional curve. Period effects from the fitted coefficients are forecast then multiplied by the basis functions, resulting in a forecast mortality curve with prediction intervals. To forecast, we adopt a state-space approach and an automatic modelling framework for selecting among exponential smoothing methods.Overall, breast cancer mortality rates in Australia remained relatively stable from 1960 to the late 1990s, but have declined over the last few years. A set of four basis functions minimized the mean integrated squared forecasting error and account for 99.3 per cent of variation around the mean mortality curve. Twenty year forecasts suggest a continuing decline, but at a slower rate, and stabilizing beyond 2010. Forecasts show a decline in all age groups with the greatest decline in older women.The proposed methods have the potential to incorporate important covariates such as hormone replacement therapy and interventions to represent mammographic screening. This would be particularly useful for evaluating the impact of screening on mortality and incidence from breast cancer.}

The aim of this paper is to present estimates for stomach cancer mortality, incidence and prevalence over the period 1970-2010 for the Italian regions and for Italy as a whole. METHODS: Estimated figures for incidence, prevalence and mortality were obtained by using the MIAMOD method. Starting from the knowledge of mortality in the period 1970-1999 and of relative survival in the period of diagnosis 1978-1994, we derived incidence and prevalence estimates and projections up to the year 2010 by means of a statistical back-calculation approach. Survival at the regional and national levels was modelled on the basis of published survival data from the Italian cancer registries. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality trends for both sexes decrease by about 60\% during the estimation period 1970-2010. Both indicators show a 2-fold male/female ratio all over the country, and a similar gender time trend. The incidence and mortality in the North and Center of the country are estimated to be higher and to decrease more steeply than those in the South, both for men and women. A total of around 13,000 incident cases, 57,000 prevalent cases, and 8,000 deaths are estimated to have occurred in Italy in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality trends are estimated to decline during the entire period 1970-2010, with different slopes between northern-central and southern regions.The incidence and mortality are quite similar among Italian regions, showing that the risk of developing the disease diminishes and is becoming more homogeneous than in the past decades all over the country.}

The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap test result histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap test result adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing and proportion of high grade ({\textgreater}or=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN2]) abnormalities found in a woman's total recorded test result history; and (ii) with regard to the last Pap test result against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap test result. The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman's prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the '1 in n' odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap test result, and by a given last Pap test result for various prior Pap test result histories.RESULTS: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap test result was 1 in 5,546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age and by the highest Pap test result prior to the most recent Pap test result: the higher the age and, less consistently, the higher the previous highest Pap test result for a given last Pap test result, the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer.CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given Pap test result, and for some combinations of the last Pap test result and highest recorded prior Pap test result.}

DESIGN: A 35-item questionnaire. SETTINGS: Primary care clinic waiting rooms. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 968 women. INTERVENTION: Women received standardized descriptions of the meaning of ASCUS and LSIL Papanicolaou smear classifications and uniform descriptions of the 4 triage tests: Papanicolaou smear, human papillomavirus DNA test, cervicography, and colposcopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects' responses to questionnaire. RESULTS: More women (58.4\%) preferred a repeat Papanicolaou smear for an ASCUS report than would choose human papillomavirus DNA testing (7.3\%), cervicography (20.6\%), or colposcopy (13.8\%) (P {\textless} .001, chi 2). Alternatively, 51\% of women wanted colposcopy to evaluate an LSIL report compared with the other 3 options (P {\textless} .001, chi 2). Test accuracy was the most important factor that influenced women's decisions for each test, compared with cost, discomfort, and other reasons (P {\textless} .001, chi 2). Positive predictors for women's selection of colposcopy to evaluate a Papanicolaou smear showing LSIL included older age (P {\textless} .01, logistic regression analysis), higher level of income (P {\textless} .001, chi 2), greater level of education (P {\textless} .001, logistic regression analysis), greater level of knowledge of colposcopy and Papanicolaou smears (P {\textless} .001, logistic regression analysis), family history of cervical cancer (P {\textless} .01, chi 2), and history of cervical dysplasia (P = .02, chi 2). CONCLUSIONS: Most women preferred a repeat Papanicolaou smear to further evaluate an initial Papanicolaou smear demonstrating ASCUS and colposcopy to evaluate a report of LSIL. Women identified test accuracy as the most important reason for triage test selection. Multiple factors, primarily involving patient and family history of cervical neoplasia, level of education, income, age, and knowledge of tests, influence women's desire for specific triage tests. Because no optimal management of women with ASCUS and LSIL Papanicolaou smear reports has been determined, consideration of women's triage test preferences should complement overall patient care.}

METHODS: We examined age-standardized incidence and mortality trends of prostate cancer in South Korea to gain further insight into prostate cancer etiology. RESULTS: Although prostate cancer incidence has been low (7.9 per 100,000 man-years), it has increased up to 28.2\% between 1996-1998 and 1999-2001. Prostate cancer mortality increased 12.7-fold over a 20-year period. Despite the increase in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, marked differences in rates remain for Koreans, Korean Americans, and Caucasian Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The rising rates of prostate cancer in South Korea cannot be attributed entirely to PSA screening due to the low PSA screening prevalence; this trend is most likely related to increased westernization among Koreans. Interdisciplinary epidemiological studies incorporating the collection of biological samples are needed to clarify the extent to which lifestyle and genetic factors contribute to the observed racial disparity.}

Special attention is given to the task of model selection, which involves selection of the model form, selection of the variables to enter the model, and selection of the form of these variables in the model. Several conclusions are drawn, among them: a) model and variable forms should be selected based on regression diagnostic procedures, in addition to goodness-of-fit tests; b) variable-selection algorithms in current packaged programs, such as conventional stepwise regression, can easily lead to invalid estimates and tests of effect; and c) variable selection is better approached by direct estimation of the degree of confounding produced by each variable than by significance-testing algorithms. As a general rule, before using a model to estimate effects, one should evaluate the assumptions implied by the model against both the data and prior information.}

METHODS: A series of radio scripts and newspaper advertisements ran weekly in the Italian-language media over two, four-week periods. Monthly mammography screens were analysed to determine if numbers of Italian-speaking women in the program increased during the two campaign periods, using interrupted time series regression analysis. A survey of Italian-speaking women attending BreastScreen NSW during the campaign period (n=240) investigated whether individuals had heard or seen the advertisements. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the number of initial or subsequent mammograms in Italian-speaking women between the campaign periods and the period prior to (or after) the campaign. Twenty per cent of respondents cited the Italian media campaign as a prompt to attend. Fifty per cent had heard the radio ad and 30\% had seen the newspaper ad encouraging Italian-speaking women to attend BSNSW. The most common prompt to attend was the BSNSW invitation letter, followed by information or recommendation from a GP. CONCLUSION: Radio and newspaper advertisements developed for the Italian community did not significantly increase attendance to BSNSW. IMPLICATIONS: Measures of program effectiveness based on self-report may not correspond to aggregate screening behaviour. The development of the media campaign in conjunction with the Italian community, and the provision of appropriate levels of resourcing, did not ensure the media campaign's success.}

RESULTS: At the time of presentation 295 (15.5\%) patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and there was a highly significant tendency for lower CD4 counts in this group (median 67/mm3) than in patients free of AIDS (median 369/mm3). A total of 757 patients had data available on follow-up and were free of AIDS at the first visit. During a median follow-up of 0.9 years, 110 developed AIDS or AIDS-related death (12.2/100 person years). Subjects with CD4 count {\textless} 200/mm3 at initial visit showed over a ninefold increase in risk of developing AIDS compared to subjects with levels {\textgreater} or = 500/mm3 (relative risk [RR] = 9.1; 95\% CI: 5.4-16.0). The rate/100 person years was 47.1 compared with 6.0 in subjects with levels {\textgreater} or = 500/mm3. After adjusting for initial CD4 count, homosexual men showed over a twofold increase in risk of developing AIDS compared to heterosexuals (RR = 2.4; 95\% CI: 1.6-4.4) and intravenous drug users (IVDU) showed nearly a twofold increase (RR = 1.8; 95\% CI: 0.9-3.9). The increased risk in homosexual men persisted even after further adjustment for clinical stage (RR = 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.3-3.7) but the increased risk in IVDU was attenuated (RR = 1.5; 95\% CI: 0.7-3.2) although it remained increased albeit non-significantly. Men tended to progress faster to AIDS than women but the difference was not significant. However, the faster progression in homosexual men was seen even when compared to heterosexual men only. CONCLUSION: The rate of progression of AIDS according to CD4 count group at baseline in this Thai cohort is broadly comparable with Western cohorts. It appears that heterosexuals in Thailand show slower progression to AIDS than homosexual men},

As a follow-on from previous reviews of prevailing evidence, this review critically evaluates more recent studies on this relationship--concentrating on those published between 1997 and 2004--including lung cancer to mesothelioma ratios, the interactive effects of cigarette smoke and asbestos in combination, and the cumulative exposure model for lung cancer induction as set forth in The Helsinki Criteria and The AWARD Criteria (as opposed to the asbestosis--{\textgreater}cancer model), together with discussion of differential genetic susceptibility/resistance factors for lung carcinogenesis by both cigarette smoke and asbestos. The authors conclude that: (i) the prevailing evidence strongly supports the cumulative exposure model; (ii) the criteria for probabilistic attribution of lung cancer to mixed asbestos exposures as a consequence of the production and end-use of asbestos-containing products such as insulation and asbestos-cement building materials--as embodied in The Helsinki and AWARD Criteria--conform to, and are further consolidated by, the new evidence discussed in this review; (iii) different attribution criteria (e.g., greater cumulative exposures) are appropriate for chrysotile mining/milling and perhaps for other chrysotile-only exposures, such as friction products manufacture, than for amphibole-only exposures or mixed asbestos exposures; and (iv) emerging evidence on genetic susceptibility/resistance factors for lung cancer risk as a consequence of cigarette smoking, and potentially also asbestos exposure, suggests that genotypic variation may represent an additional confounding factor potentially affecting the strength of association and hence the probability of causal contribution in the individual subject, but at present there is insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions concerning variation in asbestos-mediated lung cancer risk relative to such resistance/susceptibility factors.}

The outcome for each cancer site was the incidence of disease that had reached a late stage at the time of diagnosis. Two sets of predictors were used: (1) census-based demographic variables and (2) census-based demographic variables together with the cancer-specific mortality rate. RESULTS. The best models accounted for a substantial percentage of between area variability in late-stage rates for cancer of the breast (46\%), cervix (61\%), and colon/rectum (58\%). A validation procedure indicated that correct identification of small areas with high rates of late-stage disease was two to three times more likely when model-based estimates were used than when areas were selected at random. CONCLUSIONS. Additional testing is needed to establish the generality of the geographic targeting methodology developed in this paper. However, there are strong indications that small-area estimation models will be useful in many regions where planners wish to target cancer screening programs on a geographic basis.}

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a common facultative intracellular parasite of the macrophage in advanced HIV disease and may induce macrophage activation. Whether MAC disease is associated with DSPN was examined prospectively. METHODS: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with HIV infection were assessed for the probability of DSPN. Blood cultures for MAC were performed, independently of neurological assessment, as part of the investigation of unexplained fever, anaemia, weight loss, or, less commonly, diarrhoea. RESULTS: There were 20 patients with possible, 14 with probable, and 22 with definite HIV DSPN. Blood cultures for MAC were performed on 80 patients, of whom 39 were positive and 41 negative. The test for trend, when corrected for CD4 count, disclosed a significant association (P = 0.01). There was no statistically significant association between DSPN and cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. CONCLUSION: Coinfection of the macrophage by MAC may further activate the HIV infected macrophage thereby accelerating the elaboration of neural toxins or MAC infection of the macrophage itself may lead to the production of neural toxins},

In a cohort of 53 male study subjects (age, 33 +/- 7 years), who consecutively presented with primary HIV-1 infection, we analyzed the relationship between early plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, beta2- microglobulin, and p24-antigen levels determined in the first 3 months and subsequent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts 6 to 12 months after onset of primary symptoms. Peak, nadir, and median HIV-1 RNA levels in the first 30 days were already significantly associated with HIV-1 RNA levels at 6 to 12 months (p = .02, p {\textless} .0001, and p = .01, respectively). Similarly, early nadir and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in the first 30 days showed a significant relationship with CD4+ T-cell counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .009 and p = .0008, respectively). Study subjects with an early decline of CD4+ counts to {\textless}500 cells/microl had an eightfold higher risk that CD4+ counts were {\textless}500 cells/microl at 1 year. Of all evaluated virologic parameters, only nadir HIV-1 RNA at 76 days predicted CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .006). Early HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ counts are already associated with the time course of those parameters 6 to 12 months after onset of symptoms. Nadir viral load was the strongest predictor of HIV-1 RNA levels as well as of CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months. An early decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes may be a useful clinical prognostic marker for rapid disease progression},

Twenty-two people were retrospectively found to have seroconverted to HIV during the interval. Each seroconverter was matched to two seronegative and two seropositive controls. Matched case-control analyses using the seronegative controls determined that the following symptoms lasting for 3 or more days were associated with new HIV infection: fever greater than 37.7 degrees C, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats and headaches. Matched case-control analyses using the seropositive controls determined that the following symptoms lasting for 3 or more days were associated with new HIV infection: fatigue, fever greater than 37.7 degrees C, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats and headaches. It was notable that the majority of seroconversions were not associated with any symptoms lasting for 3 or more days. Due to their non-specificity, symptoms associated with seroconversion are not likely to have a high positive predictive value. In high risk populations, however, appearance of these symptoms may facilitate identification of early infection that may be important for studies of natural history or for optimal timing for initiating antiviral therapy.}

AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Socioeconomic circumstances influence health. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Generally, poorer socioeconomic circumstances lead to poorer health. This has generated a search for generic mechanisms that could explain such a general association. However, we propose that there is a greater variation in the association between SEP and health than is generally acknowledged when specific health outcomes are investigated. We propose that studying these variations provide a better understanding of the aetiological mechanisms relating specific diseases with specific exposures. AREAS TO DEVELOP RESEARCH: Using different indicators of SEP in health research can better capture these variations and is important when evaluating the full contribution of confounding by socioeconomic conditions. We propose that using an array of SEP indicators within a life course framework also offers considerable opportunity to explore causal pathways in disease aetiology.}

For cancer mortality for specific sites no significant (P {\textless} 0.01) positive gradients were observed, although for melanoma (m,f) a positive gradient at P {\textless} 0.05 was found. Mortality for all cancers considered together in both sexes was significantly higher in the low SES group compared to the high SES group. This is partly because the more-fatal cancers are more common in the lower SES groups. Diet, tobacco use, reproductive factors, occupational and sun exposures are likely to be associated with the patterns observed but are not investigated in this study.

The purpose of this study was to estimate and project the value of life lost from cancer deaths in the United States. METHODS: We estimated and projected US age-specific mortality rates for all cancers and for 16 types of cancer in men and 18 cancers in women in the years 2000-2020 and applied them to US population projections to estimate the number of deaths in each year. Cohort life tables were used to calculate the remaining life expectancy in the absence of cancer deaths-the person-years of life lost (PYLL). We used a willingness-to-pay approach in which the value of life lost due to cancer death was calculated by multiplying PYLL by an estimate of the value of 1 year of life (\$150,000). We performed sensitivity analyses for female breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers using varying assumptions about future cancer mortality rates through the year 2020. RESULTS: The value of life lost from all cancer deaths in the year 2000 was \$960.6 billion; lung cancer alone represented more than 25\% of this value. Projections for the year 2020 with current cancer mortality rates showed a 53\% increase in the total value of life lost (\$1472.5 billion). Projected annual decreases of cancer mortality rates of 2\% reduced the expected value of life lost in the year 2020 from \$121.0 billion to \$80.7 billion for breast cancer, \$140.1 billion to \$93.5 billion for colorectal cancer, from \$433.4 billion to \$289.4 billion for lung cancer, and from \$58.4 billion to \$39.0 billion for prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated value of life lost due to cancer deaths in the United States is substantial and expected to increase dramatically, even if mortality rates remain constant, because of expected population changes. These estimates and projections may help target investments in cancer control strategies to tumor sites that are likely to result in the greatest burden of disease and to interventions that are the most cost-effective.},

Cell survival curve forms being either conventional or allowing for low-dose hypersensitivity (LDH) were investigated. Quality-of-fit tests for non-nested models were used in comparisons with the types of empirical risk models applied at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) in Hiroshima. In general the TSCE model was found to represent the data more economically (i.e., with fewer parameters for a similarly good description of the data) than the empirical risk model. However, the data are not strong enough to give a clear preference to one of the very different model types used. Central ERR and EAR estimates (at 1 Sv, for age at exposure 30 and age attained 70) from TSCE and empirical models were in good agreement with each other and with previously published estimates. However, the TSCE models including radiation-induced cell inactivation resulted in a lower estimate of the relative risk at young ages at exposure (0-15 years) than the empirical model. Also the TSCE model allowing for radiation-induced cell inactivation with a conventional cell survival curve resulted at 0.2 Sv in significantly lower risk estimates than the model with LDH. These model differences have been used here to suggest risk estimates which include model uncertainty as well as the usual statistical uncertainty. Model uncertainties were small for central estimates and larger for other values of the variables. Applying the proposed method to excess risk for all solid cancer at 1 Sv, age at exposure 10 and age attained 70, results in total uncertainty ranges that are wider than the pure statistical uncertainty range by about 30\% for both ERR and EAR.}

DESIGN: An observational study, with prospectively collected data. METHODS: All patients attending the HIV Outpatient clinic as of 1 January 1995 (n = 2083) were included. Follow-up was until the first AIDS-defining event or death. Associations between viral load or CD4 cell count and disease progression were assessed using a person-years approach. Event rates were compared using Poisson regression analysis; a multivariate model was used to assess the independent effects of CD4, viral load and treatment group on event rates and to consider interactions between these variables. RESULTS: The event rates increased with lower CD4 cell count and higher viral load for both treatment groups and were generally lower in the HAART group. In a multivariate analysis, lower CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads remained significantly associated with disease progression, irrespective of treatment group. However, the event rate was significantly lower for the HAART group compared with the control group (relative rate 0.53, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HAART-treated patients with high viral loads and CD4 cell counts experienced reduced disease progression compared with individuals with the same CD4 cell count and viral load not receiving HAART. Consequently, the short-term prognosis associated with viral load levels and CD4 cell counts may differ in patients on HAART. Whether this effect will be observed with non-protease-inhibitor-containing HAART is not known at this time},

A total of 3128 subjects was recruited to the observational, prospective EuroSIDA study in May 1994. These were consecutive patients (up to a predefined limit) seen at outpatient clinics in 37 centers from 16 European countries and followed at 6-month intervals by use of standardized forms completed by clinicians at the respective centers. This report concerns 2367 subjects who began antiretroviral therapy with a regime that included zidovudine either before study entry or during the course of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted, with use of other antiretroviral drugs, CD4 count, and date of development of AIDS fitted as time-dependent covariates. Survival times from start of therapy were left truncated at study entry to avoid survival bias. In addition to zidovudine, antiretroviral drugs used included didanosine (ddI) (n = 1119; median 1.6 years after starting zidovudine), dideoxycytidine (ddC) (n = 592; median 1.9 years after starting zidovudine), stavudine (d4T) (n = 241; median 2.9 years after starting zidovudine) and lamivudine (3TC) (n = 33 ; median 2.7 years after starting zidovudine). Of the 2367 patients, 613 died during follow-up. Overall, risk of death was reduced in those zidovudine-treated patients who began at least one other nucleoside analogue drug with or after taking zidovudine (relative hazard [RH], 0.61; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.72, adjusting for CD4 count, development of AIDS, and age). Fitting each drug separately, there was a larger association with reduced mortality for starting 3TC (RH, 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.62) than for starting ddl (RH, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.93), ddC (RH, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.92) or d4T (RH, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.91).

In the first step, the authors utilized primary epidemiologic data from a longitudinal study of women in Brazil and identified a plausible range for each input parameter that produced model output within the 95\% confidence intervals of the data. In the second step, they performed a simultaneous search over all input parameters to identify parameter sets that produced output consistent with data from multiple sources. A goodness-of-fit score was computed for 555,000 unique parameter sets using a likelihood-based approach, and a sample of good-fitting parameter sets was used in the model to illustrate the advantage of the calibration approach by projecting a range of benefits associated with cervical cancer prevention policies. The calibrated model had reasonable fit to the data in terms of duration and prevalence of HPV infection for high-risk types, prevalence of precancerous lesions, and incidence of cancer. The authors found that leveraging primary data from longitudinal studies provides unique opportunities for model parameterization of the unobservable nature of HPV infection and its role in the development of cervical cancer.}

OBJECTIVE: We present contemporary variations in PCa incidence and mortality patterns across five continents using the most recent data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PCa incidence and mortality estimates for 2008 from GLOBOCAN are presented. We also examine recent trends in PCa incidence rates for 40 countries and mortality rates for 53 countries from 1985 and onward via join-point analyses using an augmented version of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents and the World Health Organization mortality database. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Estimated PCa incidence rates remain most elevated in the highest resource counties worldwide including North America, Oceania, and western and northern Europe. Mortality rates tend to be higher in less developed regions of the world including parts of South America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing PCa incidence rates during the most recent decade were observed in 32 of the 40 countries examined, whereas trends tended to stabilize in 8 countries. In contrast, PCa mortality rates decreased in 27 of the 53 countries under study, whereas rates increased in 16 and remained stable in 10 countries. CONCLUSIONS: PCa incidence rates increased in nearly all countries considered in this analysis except in a few high-income countries. In contrast, the increase in PCa mortality rates mainly occurred in lower resource settings, with declines largely confined to high-resource countries.},

METHODS: A notification form is mailed regularly to thoracic physicians and occupational physicians in the Australian states of Victoria and Tasmania, who use this to report new cases of occupational lung disease. The validation study was performed by a blinded panel of two doctors, who reviewed information extracted from the medical files of a sample of reported cases of occupational asthma. RESULTS: A total of 520 diagnoses were reported. The mean (+/- SD) age of the 448 patients notified was 55.7 +/- 16.2 years. There were 394 (88\%) males and 54 females. The most common single condition was asthma for which the most common causative agent was wood dust. However, the most commonly reported agent overall was asbestos. The validation study of occupational asthma found only fair agreement (kappa = 0.4) between the panel and notifying doctors. However, agreement was better (kappa = 0.5) when the analysis was restricted to those cases where the reporting doctor considered the likelihood of the diagnosis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational asthma is the most common occupational respiratory condition reported, which suggests increasing importance for this disease over more traditional forms of occupational lung disease. The validation study suggests that such schemes should restrict notifications only to those cases where the likelihood of the diagnosis is considered high.}

D. Anderson Cancer Center, April 11-14, 2002. The authors provide an overview of mathematical modeling, especially decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis, and examples of how it can be used for clinical decision making regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer. Included are applications as well as theory regarding decision science and cervical cancer. Mathematical modeling can answer such questions as the optimal frequency for screening, the optimal age to stop screening, and the optimal way to diagnose cervical cancer. Results from one mathematical model demonstrated that a vaccine against high-risk strains of human papillomavirus was a cost-effective use of resources, and discussion of another model demonstrated the importance of collecting direct non-health care costs and time costs for cost-effectiveness analysis. Research presented indicated that care must be taken when applying the results of population-wide, cost-effectiveness analyses to reduce health disparities. Mathematical modeling can encompass a variety of theoretical and applied issues regarding decision science and cervical cancer. The ultimate objective of using decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness models is to identify ways to improve women's health at an economically reasonable cost.}

After adjustment for all variables, phenotypic resistance to zidovudine remained the only significantly associated factor, independent of baseline CD4+ cell count, baseline CDC classification, and virus load},

The data were for 1,951 patients, who were diagnosed in 1977-1991, recorded by the Registry of Digestive Tumors of Cote d'Or, France, and followed for up to 15 years. Models include the Cox proportional hazards model and its three generalizations that allow for hazard ratio to change over time: 1) the piecewise model where hazard ratio is a step function; 2) the model with interaction between a predictor and a parametric function of time; and 3) the non-parametric regression spline model. Results illustrate the importance of accounting for non-proportionality of hazards, and some advantages of flexible non-parametric modeling of time-dependent effects. The authors provide empirical evidence for the dependence of the results of piecewise and parametric models on arbitrary a priori choices, regarding the number of time intervals and specific parametric function, which may lead to biased estimates and low statistical power. The authors demonstrate that a single, a priori selected spline model recovers a variety of patterns of changes in hazard ratio and fits better than other models, especially when the changes are non-monotonic, as in the case of cancer stages.}

Data from a baseline cross-sectional random survey were used together with data on whether screening was subsequently completed or refused. The subjects were a random sample of women attending an urban public hospital primary care clinic for routine medical care with a birth year of 1924 or earlier. RESULTS. Among the 271 women in the study group, 70\% completed screening. Stated intent was the strongest predictor of participation; women who intended to have both mammography and Pap testing were 2.7 times more likely to participate than those who intended to have neither test (95\% confidence interval 1.4, 4.9; P {\textless} 0.01), controlling for age, insurance status, and level of chronic illness. Women who had more than three chronic illnesses were twice as likely to participate than those with three or fewer illnesses (95\% confidence interval 1.1, 3.4 P {\textless} 0.02), controlling for the remaining variables. Other variables, including age, history of a recent screening examination, attitudes, or knowledge, were not related to participation. Stated intent was the only variable that predicted compliance with both mammography and Pap smear completion in separate regression models for the individual tests. CONCLUSION. A high proportion of elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged black women will participate in cancer screening when it is offered in a primary care setting. Further research on behavioral intentions should be conducted to refine interventions designed to enhance the use of early cancer detection among vulnerable population groups.}

We therefore investigated the association between use of anti-herpesvirus drugs and Kaposi's sarcoma in a large unselected group of patients with AIDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a group of HIV-positive patients at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, for whom details on all AIDS-defining diagnoses made during follow-up, treatment and regular CD4 counts were available. Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependant covariates were used to assess the association between treatment with aciclovir, foscarnet and ganciclovir and risk of Kaposi's sarcoma. RESULTS: A total of 3688 patients have been followed up for a median period of 4.2 years, during which time 598 patients (16.2\%) developed Kaposi's sarcoma. After adjustments for sex, exposure category, age, treatment with antiretrovirals or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, the development of AIDS-defining conditions (including separate adjustment for the development of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) and CD4 count, there was a decreased risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma with foscarnet [relative hazard (RH), 0.38; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.15-0.95; P = 0.038] and with ganciclovir (RH, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.84; P = 0.015), but not with aciclovir (RH, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.38; P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both foscarnet and ganciclovir may have some activity in preventing the occurrence of Kaposi's sarcoma, but that aciclovir has no benefit. Further studies of the effect of these drugs on the risk of Kaposi's sarcoma is warranted},

	annote = {INTRODUCTION: The extent of early cervical rescreening, defined as rescreening earlier than the recommended interval for a given initial test result, is difficult to determine mainly because the testing history of women is incomplete, especially with newer population based screening registers. METHODS: Estimation of early rescreening is based on analysis of a 1 month cohort of women (February 1997) recorded on the New South Wales Pap Test Register (PTR) who initially tested negative and who had no recorded history of a positive test result. For the purposes of estimating early rescreening rates and sources of multiple screening occurring within the recommended 2 yearly screening interval for New South Wales, the cohort excluded the estimated proportion of women with an unrecorded history of a positive result. Approaches to exclusion were different for women with a history of a high grade result (CIN2 or higher) or a low grade result (CIN1 or lower). RESULTS: Characteristic rescreening peaks occurred at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 27 months according to negative result category. The rescreening peak at 27 months illustrates the effect of the PTR late reminder system. After adjusting the cohort for estimated proportions of women with a history of a lesion, the number of women estimated to have rescreened early was approximately 156 000 over 1997-8, and the early rescreening rate was estimated as 15.3\% of women who have a Pap test. A feasible target for reducing rescreening through service provider interventions was estimated to be a reduction of 7.4\%, based on reducing the overscreening proportion from 15.3\% to 7.9\% through truncating characteristic rescreening peaks to background levels of rescreening. This represents just under 200 000 screens that could be performed over 2 years on New South Wales women who are underscreened or unscreened without incurring additional costs due to screening. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable estimates of early cervical rescreening can be derived but some assumptions in estimating the proportion of women with a positive test result history may be needed particularly if a screening programme is new and universal recording of screening data is only recent. Characteristic peaks, as departures from a background of random noise in time plots of rescreening indicate that a component of early rescreening is systemic and the chief source of such variation in screening behaviour would be service providers.}

Many individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma where asbestos has been identified as a contributing cause of the disease have filed claims seeking compensation from asbestos settlement trusts or through the court system. An individual with mesothelioma typically has been exposed to asbestos in more than one setting and from more than one asbestos product. Apportioning risk for mesothelioma among contributing factors is an ongoing problem faced by occupational disease compensation boards, juries, parties responsible for paying damages, and currently by the U.S. Senate in its efforts to formulate a bill establishing an asbestos settlement trust. In this article we address the following question: If an individual with mesothelioma where asbestos has been identified as a contributing cause were to be compensated for his or her disease, how should that compensation be apportioned among those responsible for the asbestos exposures? For the purposes of apportionment, we assume that asbestos is the only cause of mesothelioma and that every asbestos exposure contributes, albeit differentially, to the risk. We use an extension of the mesothelioma risk model initially proposed in the early 1980s to quantify the contribution to risk of each exposure as a percentage of the total risk. The percentage for each specific discrete asbestos exposure depends on the start and end dates, the intensity, and the asbestos fiber type for the exposure. We provide justification for the use of the mesothelioma risk model for apportioning risk and discuss how to assess uncertainty associated with its application.}

	abstract = {CONTEXT

Prostate cancer screening is highly controversial, including the age to begin prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Several studies have evaluated the usefulness of baseline PSA measurements at a young age.


OBJECTIVE

Review the literature on baseline PSA testing at a young age (≤60 yr) for the prediction of prostate cancer risk and prognosis.


EVIDENCE ACQUISITION

PubMed was searched for English-language publications on baseline PSA and prostate cancer for the period ending April 2011.


EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS

In most published series, median PSA levels in the general male population range from approximately 0.4 to 0.7 ng/ml in men in their 40s and from approximately 0.7 to 1.0 ng/ml in men in their 50s. Evidence from both nonscreening and screening populations has demonstrated the predictive value of a single baseline PSA measurement for prostate cancer risk assessment. Specifically, men with baseline PSA levels above the age-group-specific median have a greater risk of prostate cancer diagnosis during the next 20-25 yr. Additional studies confirmed that higher baseline PSA levels at a young age are also associated with a greater risk of aggressive disease, metastasis, and disease-specific mortality many years later.


CONCLUSIONS

Baseline PSA measurements at a young age are significant predictors of later prostate cancer diagnosis and disease-specific outcomes. Thus baseline PSA testing may be used for risk stratification and to guide screening protocols.},

Three screening policies are compared: 2 based on cytological screening, with or without HPV testing, and 1 in which HPV testing is the primary screening method. A policy of HPV testing for women with mildly abnormal smears would have little effect on the overall incidence of invasive cancer when compared with a policy of repeat cytology, provided follow-up is efficient. Moreover, the potential value of HPV testing as a primary screening method is strongly dependent on the proportion of neoplasias that are HPV-negative. Important factors in assessing the future role of HPV testing would be cost-effectiveness and benefits from improved compliance.}

The purpose of this paper is to place the NICE guidance on dealing with uncertainty into a broader context of the requirements for decision making; to explain the general approach that was taken in its development; and to address each of the issues which have been raised in the debate about the role of probabilistic sensitivity analysis in general. The most appropriate starting point for developing guidance is to establish what is required for decision making. On the basis of these requirements, the methods and framework of analysis which can best meet these needs can then be identified. It will be argued that the guidance on dealing with uncertainty and, in particular, the requirement for probabilistic sensitivity analysis, is justified by the requirements of the type of decisions that NICE is asked to make. Given this foundation, the main issues and criticisms raised during and after the consultation process are reviewed. Finally, some of the methodological challenges posed by the need fully to characterise decision uncertainty and to inform the research agenda will be identified and discussed.}

An alternative approach to age adjustment of cancer survival rates. Eur J Cancer 2004;40:2317-22], weighted observations depending on the age structures of the study and standard populations are used to substitute the patients leading to a use of weighted counts. The relative survival ratio is then calculated in the conventional way. However, no standard error of the age-standardised relative survival estimate has been reported. In this paper, we introduce a generalisation of the well-known Greenwood formula for that purpose. This method is also applicable for the observed survival and particularly when the observed survival probabilities of the patient population differ by age stratum. The traditional Greenwood formula is a special case of the method when no specific weights are used and the observed survival probability is the same in each stratum. Data from the Finnish Cancer Registry are used for illustration.}

METHODS: The SEER-Medicare database was used to measure lifetime cancer-attributable costs of care for those with colorectal cancer surviving at least 5 yr versus age- and gender-matched controls. Costs were directly estimated, stratified by age at diagnosis and stage at diagnosis, for years 6-11 after diagnosis and then modeled to estimate lifetime costs. Cost differences between cancer cases and controls were compared to expected costs based on published guidelines for postcancer surveillance. RESULTS: Lifetime medical costs for long term survivors (future years not discounted) were up to \$19,516 higher than control costs, and were highest for younger age groups and those with early-stage disease. Excess costs for cancer survivors exceeded expected surveillance costs by \$2,223-8,822 for years 6-10 from the date of initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-attributable medical costs can be substantial for long term survivors, and exceed expected costs of surveillance. Future research is need to determine the components of excess cost in this survivor group.}

We selected incidence data of cancer registries that were included in Cancer Incidence In 5 Continents, Volumes VI-VIII covering a registration period of at least 15 years (usually 1983 to 1997) and classified each eye cancer as morphologically verified uveal melanoma, clinically diagnosed uveal melanoma, uveal melanoma identified as DCO case (Death certificate only), possibly uveal melanoma, other eye tumour or unclassifiable eye tumour and calculated age-standardized incidence rates by 3-year calendar periods using the World Standard Population as the reference. The uveal melanoma incidence decline in the United States SEER Caucasian population is due mainly to an incidence decline in the early registration period (from 1974-76 to 1986-88). The data from France and Italy suggest a recent increase in incidence. Uveal melanoma diagnosed clinically increasingly contribute to the overall uveal melanoma incidence over time. Combining all registries, the proportion of morphologically verified uveal melanoma decreased from 82\% in 1983-87 to 75\% in 1993-97. Uveal melanoma incidence rates remained quite stable during the period 1983-97. The interpretation of uveal melanoma incidence trends is complicated by missing data on topography within the eye, morphology and basis of diagnosis.}

On the basis of the model we find that initial viral containment is due to an effective immune response. The viral level after the initial peak, a surrogate marker of disease progression, was determined by the rate of reactivation of memory cells. Differences in this rate may occur because of inter- or intra-individual differences in the capability of memory cells to recognise and dispose of variants of HIV, either due to immune escape mutations within the virus or because the virus directly inhibits reactivation. With no choice of parameters could direct and indirect killing produce the gradual loss in CD4+ T cells with the observed viral behaviour. The loss of CD4+ T cells is perhaps due to defective expansion of activated cells of both HIV specific and nonspecific cells. As less memory cells are produced as a result then this compartment decreases and hence so do naive numbers through less reversion of memory cells to the naive phenotype.}

The quality of on-line information was assessed using the DISCERN quality assessment tool. Quality performance characteristics were analyzed by performing Mann-Whitney U tests. Search engine efficiency was measured by each search query as a percentage of the relevant websites included for analysis from the total returned and analyzed by performing Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of 6690 websites reviewed, 84 unique websites were identified as providing information relevant to PCS. General and meta-search engines were significantly more efficient at retrieving relevant information on PCS compared with medical search engines. The quality of information was variable, with most of a poor standard. Websites that provided referral links to other resources and a citation of evidence provided a significantly better quality of information. In contrast, websites offering a direct service were more likely to provide a significantly poorer quality of information. CONCLUSIONS: The current lack of a clear consensus on guidelines and recommendation in published data is also reflected by the variable quality of information found on-line. Specialized medical search engines were no more likely to retrieve relevant, high-quality information than general or meta-search engines.}

There were significant declines in urine flow rates in the presence of a previous hysterectomy and with increasing grades of prolapse, particularly uterine prolapse, cystocele and enterocele. Unlike the normal female population, there was also deterioration with increasing parity and age, the latter largely due to the increasing incidence of hysterectomy and prolapse with age. The 10th centile of the Liverpool Nomogram for the maximum urine flow rate was found to be the most useful discriminant for a final urodynamic diagnosis of voiding difficulties. Most urogynecology patients have no or small residual urine volumes, 74\% {\textless}10 ml and 81\% {\textless}30 ml (vs 95\% {\textless}30 ml in asymptomatic women). In urogynecology patients residuals were larger where there had been a prior hysterectomy or with grade 2 or higher uterine prolapse, cystocele and enterocele. Mean residual was 14.8 ml (vs 4.8 ml in asymptomatic women). These data indicate a higher incidence of voiding difficulties (abnormally slow urine flow (under 10th centile) and/or abnormally high residual urine volume (over 30 ml) in urogynecology patients, particularly those with higher grades of prolapse and with prior hysterectomy},

Data for younger age groups for which rates are low are often discarded from the analysis. The authors explored the effect of excluding these data, in terms of the precision and accuracy of projections, for selected cancer mortality data sets. Projections were made by using a generalized Bayesian age-period-cohort model. Smoothing was applied to each time scale to reduce random variation between adjacent parameter estimates. The sum of squared standardized residuals was used to assess the accuracy of projections, and 90\% credible intervals were calculated to assess precision. For the data sets considered, inclusion of all age groups in the analysis provided more precise age-standardized and age-specific projections as well as more accurate age-specific projections for younger age groups. An overall improvement in the accuracy of age-standardized rates was demonstrated for males but not females, which may suggest that analysis of the full data set is beneficial when projecting cancer rates with strong cohort effects.}

METHODS: The lesion was documented in step-sectioned, entirely submitted prostates of two study populations: 525 autopsied men who died of trauma and 1,000 patients who had retropubic radical prostatectomy for clinically localized carcinoma of the prostate. RESULTS: We found that HGPIN starts in young individuals and increases progressively with advancing age in both races but is more prevalent in African-Americans. Additionally, the more extensive form of HGPIN with multifocal or diffuse involvement of the gland appears at a younger age in African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic foci of HGPIN can be documented in males in the 3rd and 4th decades with the lesion becoming more extensive in older men. The finding that HGPIN is both more prevalent and its more diffuse form appears earlier in African-Americans, indicates a potentially important role for this lesion in the race-related discrepancies associated with this disease.},

PATIENTS--All 111 patients with hemophilia who seroconverted to HIV-1 between 1979 and 1985 were registered at the center. Patients have been closely followed up clinically and immunologically. OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of immunodeficiency, defined by a CD4 lymphocyte count falling beneath 0.20 and 0.05 x 10(9)/L, and death. RESULTS--Kaplan-Meier estimates suggest that almost half (46\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 26\% to 66\%) of patients alive 12 years after seroconversion will have a CD4 lymphocyte count that has remained above 0.05 x 10(9)/L. Thirty-five percent (95\% CI, 22\% to 48\%) remain above 0.20 x 10(9)/L. Thirty-seven patients died of HIV-related causes, and there was a 52\% probability (95\% CI, 35\% to 69\%) of HIV-related mortality by 12 years from seroconversion. Mortality risk was closely associated with severe immunodeficiency. There was only a 15\% chance (95\% CI, 6\% to 25\%) of HIV-related death occurring before a CD4 count of below 0.05 x 10(9)/L had been reached. There was an average of one HIV-related death per 96.7 patient-years of observation before the CD4 count had fallen below 0.05 x 10(9)/L, as compared with one death per 2.5 patient-years of observation after the CD4 count had fallen below this level (P {\textless} .0001). CONCLUSIONS--In patients with HIV infection who are closely followed up, the risk of death is low before the CD4 lymphocyte count has fallen to 0.05 x 10(9)/L, a count many patients remain above up to 12 years after seroconversion},

Samples of lung tissue, excluding tumor, of all former Wittenoom workers known to have died in Western Australia (WA) were sought from teaching hospitals, pathology departments, and the Coroner's pathologist. The lung specimens were processed using Pooley's method with TEM for counts of fibers of all types and using Smith and Naylor's method with conventional light microscopy for asbestos bodies (AB). Multiple linear regression was utilized to examine the associations between crocidolite concentrations in the lung and duration of employment at Wittenoom, time since last employed at Wittenoom, nature of job, estimated average fiber concentration at the worksite, and estimated cumulative crocidolite exposure (CCE) in fiber-years/ml for each subject. Lung tissue from 90 cases was processed and there was good agreement between counts of crocidolite fibers, asbestos bodies, and CCE. Correlations were 0.77 for AB and fibers, 0.54 for AB and CCE, and 0.58 for CCE and fibers, after log transformation. The half-life of crocidolite fibers in the lung was estimated at 92 months (95\% CI 55-277 months). Previous estimates of airborne exposure to Wittenoom crocidolite have been reasonably reliable. The relatively simple technique of light microscopy for counting ABs in lung tissue also provides a useful and reliable indication of the level of past occupational exposure to crocidolite in subjects whose exposure has been only to crocidolite. The half-life of crocidolite fibers in the lungs of former Wittenoom workers is about 7-8 years.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

In 2008, we reported that radical prostatectomy, as compared with watchful waiting, reduces the rate of death from prostate cancer. After an additional 3 years of follow-up, we now report estimated 15-year results.


METHODS

From October 1989 through February 1999, we randomly assigned 695 men with early prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy. Follow-up was complete through December 2009, with histopathological review of biopsy and radical-prostatectomy specimens and blinded evaluation of causes of death. Relative risks, with 95\% confidence intervals, were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model.


RESULTS

During a median of 12.8 years, 166 of the 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group and 201 of the 348 in the watchful-waiting group died (P=0.007). In the case of 55 men assigned to surgery and 81 men assigned to watchful waiting, death was due to prostate cancer. This yielded a cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer at 15 years of 14.6\% and 20.7\%, respectively (a difference of 6.1 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 12.0), and a relative risk with surgery of 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.44 to 0.87; P=0.01). The survival benefit was similar before and after 9 years of follow-up, was observed also among men with low-risk prostate cancer, and was confined to men younger than 65 years of age. The number needed to treat to avert one death was 15 overall and 7 for men younger than 65 years of age. Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, those with extracapsular tumor growth had a risk of death from prostate cancer that was 7 times that of men without extracapsular tumor growth (relative risk, 6.9; 95\% CI, 2.6 to 18.4).


CONCLUSIONS

Radical prostatectomy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from prostate cancer. Men with extracapsular tumor growth may benefit from adjuvant local or systemic treatment. (Funded by the Swedish Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health.).},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a serum bank stored in 1980, PSA was analysed in 658 men with no previously known prostate cancer from a well-defined cohort from Goteborg, Sweden (men born in 1913); the incidence of clinical prostate cancer was registered until 1995. From the same area, and with the same selection criteria, another cohort of 710 men born in 1930-31, who in 1995 accepted an invitation for PSA screening, was also analysed. RESULTS: Of men born in 1913, 18 (2.7\%) had died from prostate cancer and the cumulative probability of being diagnosed with clinical prostate cancer was 11.1\% (5.0\% in those with a PSA level of {\textless} 3 ng/mL vs 32.9\% in those with a PSA level of {\textgreater} 3 ng/mL, P {\textless} 0.01). The mean lead-time from increased PSA ({\textgreater} 3 ng/mL) to clinical diagnosis was 7 years. The prostate cancer detection rate in men born in 1930-31 was 4.4\% (22\% among those with increased PSA levels) and 30 of 31 detected cancers were clinically localized. CONCLUSIONS: Screening and sextant biopsies resulted in a lower detection rate (22\%) than the cumulative risk of having clinical prostate cancer (33\%) in men with increased PSA levels, indicating that under-diagnosis rather than over-diagnosis is the case at least with 'one-time' screening. Even if the stage distribution in screening-detected cancers seems promising (and thus may result in reduced mortality) it is notable that screening 67-year-old men will result in treatment a mean of 7 years before clinical symptoms occur and only one in four men anticipated to develop prostate cancer will die from the disease within 15 years. Large randomized screening trials seem mandatory to further explore the benefits and hazards of PSA screening.}

	annote = {In the prostate, the enzyme encoded by the SRD5A2 gene (5alpha-reductase) converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen that has been hypothesized to play a role in the genesis of prostate cancer. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the SRD5A2 gene, including a valine-to-leucine substitution (V89L) at codon 89, a variable number of TA dinucleotide repeats and a missense substitution at codon 49 resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine with threonine (A49T). To investigate the influence of these polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk, we conducted a case-control study nested within the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial. Genotypes were determined by PCR-based capillary electrophoresis using genomic DNA isolated from 300 cases and 300 controls matched on the basis of race, age at enrollment (within 5 years), enrollment study center and year of randomization. There was no association between V89L genotypes and prostate cancer risk. The age- and race-adjusted odds ratio (OR) associated with the VL and LL genotypes were 1.06 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-1.49) and 0.99 (95\% CI = 0.57-1.73), respectively, as compared to the VV genotype. The age- and race-adjusted odds ratio for men having 1 TA(9) or TA(18) allele was 0.98 (95\% CI = 0.64-1.48) when compared to men without TA repeats. The corresponding odds ratio for men without the TA(0) alleles was 0.68 (95\% CI = 0.21-2.19). The age- and race-adjusted odds ratio associated with having at least 1 T allele at codon 49 was 1.11 (95\% CI = 0.58-2.11), as compared to the AA genotype. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the V89L and A49T polymorphisms in the SRD5A2 gene are related to the risk of prostate cancer, but are compatible with the suggestion from earlier studies that men who are homozygous for the TA(9) or (18) alleles and men who have the TA(9)/TA(18) genotype are at a modestly reduced risk.}

METHODS: Plasma levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 were determined from the fasting bloods of 206 BPH cases admitted for treatment and 306 randomly selected population controls in Shanghai, China. RESULTS: Relative to the lowest tertile, men in the highest tertile of IGF-I levels had a significantly elevated risk of BPH (odds ratio [OR] = 2.80, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = 1.60-4.92; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001). Results for IGF-I were more pronounced after adjustment for serum androgens. In contrast, men in the highest IGFBP-3 tertile had a significantly reduced risk (OR = 0.40; 95\% CI = 0.23-0.69; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001). No associations of BPH with IGF-II and IGFBP-1 were observed. CONCLUSION: As has been previously observed for prostate cancer, we found that IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are associated with BPH risk in China. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the role of the IGF axis in BPH etiology.}

The unified approach allows to proper account for the uncertainty in the latent score estimation in the regression analysis. The Bayesian Latent Factor model is used to summarize the information on environmental pressure derived from three stressors: Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides and Inhalable Particles. We found evidence of positive correlation between Lung cancer mortality and environmental pressure indicators, in males, Tuscany (Italy), 1995-1999. Environmental pressure seems to be restricted to fourteen municipalities (top 5\% of the Latent Factor distribution). The model identified two areas with high point source emissions.}

However drug-resistant strains of HIV have quickly evolved, and the level of risky behaviour has increased in certain communities. Hence, currently the overall impact that ARV will have on HIV epidemics remains unclear. We have used a mathematical model to predict whether the current therapies: are reducing the severity of HIV epidemics, and could even lead to eradication of a high-prevalence (30\%) epidemic. We quantified the epidemic-level impact of ARV on reducing epidemic severity by deriving the basic reproduction number (R(0)(ARV)). R(0)(ARV) specifies the average number of new infections that one HIV case generates during his lifetime when ARV is available and ARV- resistant strains can evolve and be transmitted; if R(0)(ARV) is less than one epidemic eradication is possible. We estimated for the HIV epidemic in the San Francisco gay community (using uncertainty analysis), the present day value of R(0)(ARV), and the probability of epidemic eradication. We assumed a high usage of ARV and three behavioural assumptions: that risky sex would (1) decrease, (2) remain stable, or (3) increase. Our estimated values of R(0)(ARV) (median and interquartile range [IQR]) were: 0.90 (0.85-0.96) if risky sex decreases, 1.0 (0.94-1.05) if risky sex remains stable, and 1.16 (1.05- 1.28) if risky sex increases. R(0)(ARV) decreased as the fraction of cases receiving treatment increased. The probability of epidemic eradication is high (p=0.85) if risky sex decreases, moderate (p=0.5) if levels of risky sex remain stable, and low (p=0.13) if risky sex increases. We conclude that ARV can function as an effective HIV- prevention tool, even with high levels of drug resistance and risky sex. Furthermore, even a high-prevalence HIV epidemic could be eradicated using current ARV},

However, unrelated donor transplants have a higher incidence of graft failure and graft versus host disease (GVHD) than do HLA-matched sibling transplants. This increase may be due to disparities between donor and recipient for undetected HLA determinants or for non-HLA histocompatibility genes. Because of the large number of HLA loci and their high degree of polymorphism, fully compatible donors will not be found for most patients. Fortunately, a limited degree of HLA mismatch does not necessarily impair long-term survival in patients with hematologic malignancy. Current studies are defining the risk associated with mismatching for each histocompatibility locus and are developing methods for marrow transplantation that can decrease morbidity and improve survival despite genetic disparity between donor and recipient.}

However, uncertainty over diagnostic criteria and the degree of ascertainment of cases places doubt on the validity of such comparisons. In 69\% of cases, a history of work with or other exposure to asbestos was obtained. Due to the long interval between the first exposure to asbestos and the provisional diagnosis of a mesothelioma (up to 60 years), more than three-quarters of the 456 exposed cases first contacted asbestos in the years of its heavy use between 1930 and 1959.

There were six cases of histologic cervical neoplasia. The crude odds ratio for cervical neoplasia among HPV DNA positives was 18.3 (95\% CI 2.8, 120.3). The adjusted odds, controlling for age, prior screening history, current sexual activity, and past contraception use, were 12.2 (95\% CI 1.2, 122.9). Ever having had a Papanicolaou smear was protective, and there was a trend for the odds of having neoplasia to increase with age. Additional studies with larger samples of elderly women are needed. If confirmed, the results suggest that, independent of past screening, HPV may increase the risk of having cervical neoplasia for elderly women.}

We review here methodology for classifying patients into survival risk groups and for using cross-validation to evaluate such classifications. Measures of discrimination for survival risk models include separation of survival curves, time-dependent ROC curves and Harrell’s concordance index. For high-dimensional data applications, however, computing these measures as re-substitution statistics on the same data used for model development results in highly biased estimates. Most developments in methodology for survival risk modeling with high-dimensional data have utilized separate test data sets for model evaluation. Cross-validation has sometimes been used for optimization of tuning parameters. In many applications, however, the data available are too limited for effective division into training and test sets and consequently authors have often either reported re-substitution statistics or analyzed their data using binary classification methods in order to utilize familiar cross-validation. In this article we have tried to indicate how to utilize cross-validation for the evaluation of survival risk models; specifically how to compute cross-validated estimates of survival distributions for predicted risk groups and how to compute cross-validated time-dependent ROC curves. We have also discussed evaluation of the statistical significance of a survival risk model and evaluation of whether high-dimensional genomic data adds predictive accuracy to a model based on standard covariates alone.},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Despite previous randomised trials of early beta-blocker therapy in the emergency treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), uncertainty has persisted about the value of adding it to current standard interventions (eg, aspirin and fibrinolytic therapy), and the balance of potential benefits and hazards is still unclear in high-risk patients. METHODS: 45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 h of suspected acute MI onset were randomly allocated metoprolol (up to 15 mg intravenous then 200 mg oral daily; n=22,929) or matching placebo (n=22,923). 93\% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7\% had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to 4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors) and 89\% completed it. The two prespecified co-primary outcomes were: (1) composite of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest; and (2) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were by intention to treat, and used the log-rank method. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00222573. FINDINGS: Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9.4\%) patients allocated metoprolol had at least one such event compared with 2261 (9.9\%) allocated placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95\% CI 0.90-1.01; p=0.1). For death alone, there were 1774 (7.7\%) deaths in the metoprolol group versus 1797 (7.8\%) in the placebo group (OR 0.99, 0.92-1.05; p=0.69). Allocation to metoprolol was associated with five fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2.0\%] metoprolol vs 568 [2.5\%] placebo; OR 0.82, 0.72-0.92; p=0.001) and five fewer having ventricular fibrillation (581 [2.5\%] vs 698 [3.0\%]; OR 0.83, 0.75-0.93; p=0.001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these reductions were counterbalanced by 11 more per 1000 developing cardiogenic shock (1141 [5.0\%] vs 885 [3.9\%]; OR 1.30, 1.19-1.41; p{\textless}0.00001). This excess of cardiogenic shock was mainly during days 0-1 after admission, whereas the reductions in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest, or shock was significantly adverse during days 0-1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard in haemodynamically unstable patients, and moderate net benefit in those who were relatively stable (particularly after days 0-1). INTERPRETATION: The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute MI reduces the risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the first day or so after admission. Consequently, it might generally be prudent to consider starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition after MI has stabilised.}

Factors associated with not exclusively breastfeeding at discharge from the obstetric hospital after adjusting for potential confounders were: mother leaving school aged less than 18 years, mother not attending antenatal classes and the use of a dummy in the 2 weeks before the interview. Bed sharing practice in the 2 weeks before the interview was associated with exclusively breastfeeding at discharge from the obstetric hospital. Factors associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding were: mother leaving school before 18 years of age, smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day and use of a dummy. Dummy use may causally reduce breastfeeding or might be a marker for breastfeeding difficulties. There was a dose-response relationship with smoking, with heavier smokers breastfeeding for the shortest time periods. Bed sharing was associated with a longer duration of breastfeeding. This may not necessarily be a causal relationship because breastfeeding may promote bed sharing. The effect of dummy use and bed sharing on breastfeeding warrants further study.}

The incidence of colorectal cancers in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry is most consistent with a model positing two rare events followed by a high-frequency event in the conversion of a normal stem cell into an initiated cell that expands clonally to give rise to an adenomatous polyp. Only one more rare event appears to be necessary for malignant transformation. The two rare events involved in initiation are interpreted to represent the homozygous loss of adenomatous polyposis coli gene function. The subsequent transition of a preinitiated stem cell into an initiated cell capable of clonal expansion via symmetric division is predicted to occur with a frequency too high for a mutational event but may reflect a positional effect in colonic crypts. Our results suggest it is not necessary to invoke genomic instability to explain colorectal cancer incidence rates in human populations. Temporal trends in the incidence of colon cancer appear to be dominated by calendar year effects. The model also predicts that interventions, such as administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, designed to decrease the growth rate of adenomatous polyps, are very efficient at lowering colon cancer risk substantially, even when begun later in life. By contrast, interventions that decrease the rate of mutations at the adenomatous polyposis coli locus are much less effective in reducing the risk of colon cancer.}

METHODS: A state-transition mathematical model was used to simulate the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer in a cohort of U.S. women. Strategies included no screening and screening at different frequencies with conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology with HPV testing used for triage of equivocal results, and HPV DNA testing and cytology in combination after women had reached the age of 30. Outcomes measured included cancer incidence, life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The estimated reduction in lifetime risk of cervical cancer varies from 81\% to 93\% depending on the screening frequency, type of cytology, and test strategy. Every 3-year screening with liquid-based cytology administered to women at all ages and every 3-year screening using HPV DNA testing and cytology in combination administered to women aged 30 years or more provide equivalent or greater benefits than those provided by annual conventional cytology and have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 95300 and US dollars 228700 per year of life gained, respectively. In comparison, annual screening with HPV DNA testing and cytology in combination provides only a few hours of additional life expectancy and has a cost-effectiveness ratio of more than Us dollars 2000000 per year of life gained. CONCLUSIONS: For women aged 30 years and more, every 2- or 3-year screening strategy that uses either HPV DNA testing in combination with cytology for primary screening or cytology with reflex HPV DNA testing for equivocal results will provide a greater reduction in cancer and be less costly than annual conventional cytology.}

A mathematical model of HPV type 16 infection and progression to cervical cancer, parameterised to represent the infection in Finland, was used to explore the optimal age at vaccination and pattern of vaccine introduction. In the long term, the annual proportion of cervical cancer cases prevented is much higher when early adolescents are targeted. Vaccinating against hr HPV generates greater long-term benefits if vaccine is delivered before the age at first sexual intercourse. However, vaccinating 12 year olds delays the predicted decrease in cervical cancer, compared to vaccinating older adolescents or young adults. Vaccinating males as well as females has more impact on the proportion of cases prevented when vaccinating at younger ages. Implementing catch-up vaccination at the start of a vaccination programme would increase the speed with which a decrease in HPV and cervical cancer incidence is observed.}

The study includes a comparison between viral mRNA and DNA detection. PreTect HPV-Proofer was used for HPV E6/E7 mRNA detection from the 5 high-risk types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45, and Gp5+/6+ consensus PCR was used for HPV DNA detection. Twice as many women were positive for HPV DNA (54.6\%) than for HPV mRNA (23.4\%). PreTect HPV-Proofer and consensus PCR had a sensitivity of 85.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 42.1-99.6) for detecting CIN2+ during follow-up. The specificity was significantly higher for PreTect HPV-Proofer, 84.9\% (95\% CI = 73.9-92.5), than for consensus PCR, 50.0\% (95\% CI = 37.4-62.6). PreTect HPV-Proofer positive women were 69.8 times (95\% CI = 4.3-1137.3) more likely to be diagnosed with CIN2+ within 2 years than PreTect HPV-Proofer negative women. Consensus PCR-positive women were 5.7 times (95\% CI = 0.6-52.0) more likely to be diagnosed with CIN2+ within 2 years than PCR-negative women. With equal sensitivity and higher specificity than consensus PCR, the PreTect HPV-Proofer might offer an improvement for the triage of women with ASCUS or LSIL Pap smear. (c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time.
METHODS: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights.
FINDINGS: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2·503 billion) to 2010 (2·490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23\% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41\% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25\% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80\% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47\% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43\% from non-communicable diseases, and 10\% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35\%, 54\%, and 11\%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29\%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44\% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19\% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51\% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351\% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37\% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34\% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions.
INTERPRETATION: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.

METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was used to simulate an age-stratified cohort of 100,000 active duty women in the U.S. Army. Total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for different modalities of screening: liquid-based cytology with testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) irrespective of cytologic results compared with liquid-based cytology with HPV detection for cytologic results of atypical cells of undetermined significance (reflex HPV). The costs and outcomes of these screening methods were evaluated separately as well as in combination (liquid-based cytology and reflex HPV before age 30 years and DNA and Pap test every 3 years thereafter). Each of these screening methods was evaluated at 1-, 2-, and 3-year intervals. RESULTS: A screening strategy of liquid-based cytology and reflex HPV every 2 or 3 years is the least costly strategy among active duty women irrespective of age, especially when accounting for time costs associated with screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervix cancer. A strategy of liquid-based cytology and HPV testing irrespective of cytology results is the most effective strategy; however, it is also the most costly of the strategies tested, even when performed in patients older than 30 years of age. CONCLUSION: In the U.S. Army, cervix cancer screening performed with liquid-based cytology and reflex HPV testing of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance performed every 2 years is cost-effective, especially when indirect costs are considered.}

The study was a large nation-wide case-control study, which compared 485 cases with 1800 controls. Parents of 393 (81.0\%) cases and 1591 (88.4\%) controls were interviewed. Obstetric records were also examined. Infants dying in winter were older and had lower birthweights than those dying in summer. The increased risk of SIDS associated with prone sleeping position was greater in winter than in summer. In contrast, the increased risk of SIDS associated with excess thermal insulation and bed sharing was less in winter than in summer. Prone sleeping position accounts for about half of the difference between the mortality rate in summer and that in winter. This suggests that some factor related to season modifies the effect orf prone sleeping position.}

With the advent of sensitive tools for monitoring HIV replication in infected persons, the risk for disease progression and death can be assessed accurately and the efficacy of anti-HIV therapies can be determined directly. Furthermore, when used appropriately, combinations of newly available, potent antiviral therapies can effect prolonged suppression of detectable levels of HIV replication and circumvent the inherent tendency of HIV to generate drug-resistant viral variants. However, as antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has become increasingly effective, it has also become increasingly complex. Familiarity with recent research advances is needed to ensure that newly available therapies are used in ways that most effectively improve the health and prolong the lives of HIV-infected persons. To enable practitioners and HIV-infected persons to best use rapidly accumulating new information about HIV disease pathogenesis and treatment, the Office of AIDS Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection. This Panel was asked to define essential scientific principles that should be used to guide the most effective use of antiretroviral therapies and viral load testing in clinical practice. On the basis of detailed consideration of the most current data, the Panel delineated 11 principles that address issues of fundamental importance for the treatment of HIV infection. These principles provide the scientific basis for the specific treatment recommendations made by the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infection sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The reports of both of these panels are provided in this supplement. Together, they summarize new data and provide both the scientific basis and specific guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected persons. This information will be of interest to health care providers, HIV-infected persons, HIV and AIDS educators, public health educators, public health authorities, and all organizations that fund medical care of HIV-infected persons.}

An increase in cell proliferation rates leads to an increase in mutation rates per unit of time, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the risk of cancer. An increase in cell division rates relative to death or differentiation rates may lead to an increase in the population of critical target cells, which, again, leads to an increase in cancer risk. These fundamental principles are well illustrated by the rodent liver model for carcinogenesis. In this paper I briefly discuss some of the consequences of incorporating cell proliferation kinetics into quantitative models of cancer risk assessment. Consideration of cell kinetics can shed light on apparently paradoxical observations, such as the observation that the administration of two different promoters may lead to the same volume fraction in the rodent liver, with one promoter giving rise to a large number of small foci and the other to a small number of large foci. Another observation that can be illuminated by a consideration of cellular proliferation kinetics is the phenomenon of the inverse dose-rate effect. It has been observed with exposure to high LET radiation and to certain chemicals that fractionation of a given total dose of the agent leads to an increased lifetime probability of tumor. A biological explanation of this finding can be given in terms of the effect of the agent on cell proliferation kinetics.}

This rather startling result is discussed along with implications to extended space missions that include a significant amount of high-LET radiation. It is suggested that the effect might be caused by a 'Bystander Effect' by which normal cells in the vicinity of initiated cells are hit by alpha particles and send out signals that modify the cell kinetics of the already-initiated clones.}

Early studies of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C suggested that development of cirrhosis was a relatively common outcome, even in the first 20 years of infection. These studies were either cross-sectional liver clinic series of people referred for assessment to specialist clinics, or longitudinal cohorts of people with post-transfusion hepatitis. More recent studies (particularly longitudinal community- based cohorts) indicate that liver disease progression is generally slow, and that a minority of people with chronic hepatitis C will develop advanced liver disease. Based on an extensive review of studies reporting on chronic hepatitis C natural history, we have developed a Markov model of liver disease progression. This model estimates that the risk of progression to cirrhosis is 7\% and 20\% after 20 and 40 years of infection, respectively. Corresponding estimates for hepatitis C-related mortality are 1\% and 4\%. However, liver disease progression is highly variable, and certain subgroups of people with chronic hepatitis C are at increased risk of advanced liver disease. Those groups include people with a heavy alcohol intake, those who have coinfection with HIV or HBV, and those who have already progressed to moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis},

To use this to investigate the effects on incidence of cervical cancer, number of smear tests and colposcopies, of different schedules for cervical screening, and the clinical management policies for dyskaryosis. METHODS--A stochastic model was developed relating the available data on tissue progression to the cytological findings. Two strategies, A and B, were compared: under A, women with any abnormal smear receive immediate colposcopy and treatment; under B, women with mild or borderline dyskaryosis have repeated smears at six monthly intervals with colposcopy only for persistent abnormalities. RESULTS--The model predicted an incidence of invasive cervical cancer in an unscreened population of women aged over 18 years of 5.9 per 10,000 per year. With 70\% coverage and three yearly screening under strategy A, the incidence fell to 2.00 and under B to 2.10. The number of smears required was similar but A required two to three times as many colposcopies as B. Raising the coverage to 90\% reduced the incidence to around 1 per 10,000 per year but changing the screening interval, the specificity or sensitivity of cytology had much less effect. CONCLUSION--The model has been tested under a wide range of possible variations in natural history, specificity and sensitivity of cytology. For low grade smear abnormalities, open colposcopic referral is predicted to reduce invasive cancer only slightly more than repeat cytology, at the expense of much additional colposcopy. Improving cytological coverage is suggested as more effective in reducing invasive cancer than increased use of colposcopy or more frequent screening.}

The presence of HHV-6 DNA in an organ was significantly associated with elevated HIV-1 proviral DNA (difference in HIV median loads, 1.3 log10 genomes; P = 0.004). Consistent with this, there was a trend for the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA to be associated with an elevated HHV-6 load (0.44 log10 difference; P = 0.07). In contrast, there were no significant differences between viral loads in the combinations of either CMV or HHV-7 with HIV-1 proviral DNA load. Pairwise combinations of the beta-herpesviruses revealed that the quantity of HHV-7 was increased in the presence of HHV-6 (difference in median loads, 1.3 log10; P = 0.001) and the quantity of HHV-6 was increased in the presence of HHV-7 (difference in median loads, 0.7 log10; P=0.002). These results demonstrate that the presence of HHV-6 in an organ is significantly associated with an elevated HIV-1 proviral load and have implications for understanding HIV pathogenesis in the human host and the role that beta-herpesviruses, especially HHV-6, might play as cofactors in the HIV disease process},

Such large respondent numbers allowed control of confounding by exclusion to isolate employment transition groups suitable for hypothesis testing and quantification of causal relationships. Psychological morbidity was measured using binary outcomes of the 12 item psychological component of the General Health Questionnaire. Excluded from the analysis were those who: suffered from pre-existing physical health problems; were dissatisfied in their job; were self-employed; underwent marriage breakdown during the inter-survey period; had become widowed during the inter-survey period. A Bayesian probabilistic approach was used to calculate probabilities of psychologically normal respondents becoming psychologically morbid, given prior transition from employment to unemployment. Mantel-Haenszel analysis was utilised to estimate relative risks in comparison to a control group of those remaining employed, after controlling for age and gender. An overall relative risk of becoming psychologically disturbed as a consequence of becoming unemployed was estimated to be 1.51 (95\% CI: 1.15-1.99). The overall relative risk of recovery from psychological disturbance upon re-employment in those with psychological disturbance was estimated to be 1.63 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.48). Residual psychological effects of past unemployment experience and the effects of long-term unemployment were investigated, but found to be non-significant in this study. There was some evidence of psychological adaptation to unemployment, but this was statistically insignificant. Unemployment was a significant cause of psychological disturbance in young people who were initially employed, not suffering physical ill-health, and psychologically normal; conversely, re-employment reversed the effect.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of radical prostatectomy in patients with early prostate cancer has been assessed in only one randomized trial. In 2005, we reported that radical prostatectomy improved prostate cancer survival compared with watchful waiting after a median of 8.2 years of follow-up. We now report results after 3 more years of follow-up. METHODS: From October 1, 1989, through February 28, 1999, 695 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy (n = 347) or watchful waiting (n = 348). Follow-up was complete through December 31, 2006, with histopathologic review and blinded evaluation of causes of death. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During a median of 10.8 years of follow-up (range = 3 weeks to 17.2 years), 137 men in the surgery group and 156 in the watchful waiting group died (P = .09). For 47 of the 347 men (13.5\%) who were randomly assigned to surgery and 68 of the 348 men (19.5\%) who were not, death was due to prostate cancer. The difference in cumulative incidence of death due to prostate cancer remained stable after about 10 years of follow-up. At 12 years, 12.5\% of the surgery group and 17.9\% of the watchful waiting group had died of prostate cancer (difference = 5.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 11.1\%), for a relative risk of 0.65 (95\% CI = 0.45 to 0.94; P = .03). The difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastases did not increase beyond 10 years of follow-up. At 12 years, 19.3\% of men in the surgery group and 26\% of men in the watchful waiting group had been diagnosed with distant metastases (difference = 6.7\%, 95\% CI = 0.2 to 13.2\%), for a relative risk of 0.65 (95\% CI = 0.47 to 0.88; P = .006). Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, those with extracapsular tumor growth had 14 times the risk of prostate cancer death as those without it (RR = 14.2, 95\% CI = 3.3 to 61.8; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSION: Radical prostatectomy reduces prostate cancer mortality and risk of metastases with little or no further increase in benefit 10 or more years after surgery.},

A total of 520 cases and 988 controls matched for age, and date of blood draw were identified by linkage between the regional cancer register and the NSHDC. Receiver operating characteristic curves with area under curve (AUC) estimates were used as measures of prostate cancer prediction. The AUC for the genetic risk score was 64.3\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 61.4-67.2], and the AUC for total PSA and the ratio of free to total PSA was 86.2\% (95\% CI = 84.4-88.1). A model including the genetic risk score, total PSA and the ratio of free to total PSA increased the AUC to 87.2\% (95\% CI = 85.4-89.0, p difference = 0.002). The addition of a genetic risk score to PSA resulted in a marginal improvement in prostate cancer prediction that would not seem useful for clinical risk assessment.},

Data from the Swedish Cancer Register on prostate cancer incidence between 1980 and 2007 and published data from the Gothenburg branch of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer (ERSPC), a population-based PSA screening study, were used in two models of changes in incidence of prostate cancer as a proxy for uptake of PSA testing in all 24 Swedish counties. The estimated annual PSA testing, irrespective of previous years' exposure, reached a peak of 12\% of all men in 2004 and decreased thereafter to 6\% in 2007 and varied from less than 5 to 20\% between counties. Under the assumption that men who underwent annual PSA testing were previously unexposed to PSA testing, the cumulated uptake of PSA testing in men aged 55–69 years in Sweden increased from zero in 1997 to 56\% in 2007. Our study shows that it is possible to estimate uptake of PSA testing in the population from the prostate cancer incidence pattern. There were large geographical variations in uptake of PSA testing despite a uniform health care system in Sweden and there was a substantial increase in the uptake of PSA testing during the study period, despite that there were no national recommendations for PSA-based prostate cancer screening.},

Risk of stroke was not clearly related to smoking. Among manufactured cigarette smokers, lung cancer risk tended to be lowest in those who had always smoked filter cigarettes. This pattern was, however, evident only in men who additionally smoked pipes, cigars or handrolled cigarettes and in women, not being seen in men who smoked only manufactured cigarettes. Risk of lung cancer was not clearly related to time of switch to filter cigarettes. A markedly lower risk of chronic bronchitis was seen in men, but not women, who smoked filter rather than plain cigarettes. Heart disease risk did not vary by type of cigarette smoked 10 years before admission, but, compared with those who had never smoked filter cigarettes, those who had ever smoked filter cigarettes had a higher risk in men and a lower risk in younger women. Compared with the general population, markedly more controls were ex-smokers, suggesting incipient disease, whether or not smoking related, may alter smoking habits, thus affecting the interpretability of the findings. Control smokers were also relatively much more likely to report smoking plain cigarettes than expected. This comparison, not made in other studies relating risk to type of cigarette smoked, indicates that great care must be taken in verifying validity of reported smoking habits. While our findings are compatible with other evidence that risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis is probably reduced by switching from plain to filter cigarettes, they underline the difficulties in obtaining valid evidence from epidemiological studies.}

The results are published in the form of a series of articles referring to the criteria used as prerequisites for cancer screening programmes. This article reports the data of the literature concerning risk factors, natural history, course without treatment and histological characteristics of the cancer detected. 1) Certain populations have an increased risk due to genetic factors. A family history (first degree relative) is associated with a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of prostatic cancer. This familial aggregation can be used to define a high-risk group constituting a primary target for screening. 2) The natural history of the disease, especially the progression from the asymptomatic stage to the clinical stage and the natural history of the disease at the clinical stage are now sufficiently well known. The concept of latent cancer has not been confirmed as the disease inevitably progresses. Cancers of insignificant volume, less than 0.5 cc (discovered at autopsy) are classically distinguished from cancers of significant volume, greater than 0.5 cc, but asymptomatic (risk of progression with mortality within 15 years), and local and/or metastatic symptomatic cancers. The histological prevalence of prostatic cancer is 43\% in a group of men with a mean age of 64 years and increases with age. 92\% of histological cancers have a volume less than 0.5 cc. It takes an estimated 12 years (3 doubling times) for a 0.5 cc cancer to reach a volume of 4 cc, the volume beyond which there is a risk of distant metastases. In the absence of curative treatment, a cancer diagnosed at the localized stage before the age of 65 years is associated with a specific survival of less than 30\%. The median survival of metastatic prostatic cancer is 2 to 3 years. 3) The disease can be detected at an early stage. Cancers diagnosed by an isolated elevation of PSA in a screening setting have a significant volume in more than 3 out of 4 cases, can be entirely removed by prostatectomy in more than 3 out of 4 cases and have a less advanced pathological stage than cancers diagnosed on the basis of classical criteria.}

However, by considering the two groups at equal times after injection, eliminating the effects of natural mortality and also taking into account that not all of the mesotheliomas were the cause of death, it was shown that the incidence rate of mesotheliomas was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the rats injected at age 10 months and the relative rate was estimated as about 4, with 95\% confidence limits of 1.5 and 12. An alternative explanation that the mesotheliomas occurred in the two groups at similar rates, except that in the group injected at age 10 months they occurred on average 4 months sooner after injection, is discussed. Two other groups were also injected, one at age 17 months and the other at 22 months. In the former group two early mesotheliomas were observed, 10 and 74 days after injection, but the next was not observed until over a year later. No explanation of this finding could be suggested other than the possibility that these two tumours were not associated with the asbestos treatment.}

It is not clear whether longitudinal changes in hemoglobin or administered ESA have meaningful associations with survival after adjustment for time-varying confounders. With the use of time-dependent Cox regression models, longitudinal associations were examined between survival and quarterly (13-wk averaged) hemoglobin values and administered ESA dose in a 2-yr (July 2001 to June 2003) cohort of 58,058 maintenance hemodialysis patients from a large dialysis organization (DaVita) in the United States. After time-dependent and multivariate adjustment for case mix, quarterly varying administered intravenous iron and ESA doses, iron markers, and nutritional status, hemoglobin levels between 12 and 13 g/dl were associated with the greatest survival. Among prevalent patients, the lower range of the recommended Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative hemoglobin target (11 to 11.5 g/dl) was associated with a higher death risk compared with the 11.5- to 12-g/dl range. A decrease or increase in hemoglobin over time was associated with higher or lower death risk, respectively, independent of baseline hemoglobin. Administration of any dose of ESA was associated with better survival, whereas among those who received ESA, requiring higher doses were surrogates of higher death risk. In this observational study, greater survival was associated with a baseline hemoglobin between 12 and 13 g/dl, treatment with ESA, and rising hemoglobin. Falling hemoglobin and requiring higher ESA doses were associated with decreased survival. Randomized clinical trials are required to examine these associations.}

Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.}

The age-adjusted relative risk for AIDS among CMV seropositives was 2.4 (P = 0.03). In order to determine how this adverse effect is mediated, the mean rate of decline in serial CD4+ lymphocyte counts was studied. CD4+ lymphocyte counts tended to decline more rapidly in CMV seropositives than in seronegatives (-0.087 x 10(9)/l per annum versus -0.082 x 10(9)/l per annum), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The average CD4+ lymphocyte count at the time of HIV seroconversion was estimated to be similar in CMV seropositives and negatives, because in HIV-1-negative haemophiliacs the CD4+ counts were virtually identical, after adjustment for age (0.94 x 10(9)/l and 0.97 x 10(9)/l, respectively). The median CD4+ cell count at which AIDS developed was higher in the CMV-seropositive group (0.07 x 10(9)/l) than in the seronegative group (0.04 x 10(9)/l), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. We conclude from these findings that the adverse effect of CMV is not wholly mediated via a more rapid loss of CD4+ cells. We discuss other processes that may be mediated by CMV, such as a functional deficiency of residual CD4+ cells, or dissemination of HIV in other organs, which may be important in determining the earlier onset of AIDS among CMV-seropositive subjects},

Each of the groups has chosen a different modeling methodology without purposeful attempt to be in contrast with each other. The seven groups have met biannually since November 2000 to discuss their methodology and results. This article investigates the differences in methodology. To facilitate this comparison, each of the groups submitted a description of their model into a uniformly structured web based 'model profiler'. Six of the seven models simulate a preclinical natural history that cannot be observed directly with parameters estimated from published evidence concerning screening and therapy effects. The remaining model regards published evidence on intervention effects as prior information and updates that with information from the US population in a Bayesian type analysis. In general, the differences between the models appear to be small, particularly among the models driven by natural history assumptions. However, we demonstrate that such apparently small differences can have a large impact on surveillance of population trends. We describe a systematic approach to evaluating differences in model assumptions and results, as well as differences in modeling culture underlying the differences in model structure and parameters.}

To understand this phenomenon, we explored the role that screening, treatment, iatrogenic (i.e., treatment-induced) deaths, and attribution bias (incorrect labeling of death from other causes as death from prostate cancer) have played in recent mortality trends. METHODS: Join point regression is utilized to assess the recent rise and fall in mortality and the relationship of total U.S. trends to those areas served by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Registry Program. Incidence-based mortality (IBM) is estimated with the use of prostate cancer data from the SEER Program to partition (from overall prostate cancer mortality trends) the contribution of cases diagnosed since the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing starting in 1987. IBM is also used to examine the contribution of stage at diagnosis to the recent prostate cancer mortality trends. RESULTS: IBM for cases diagnosed since 1987 rose above the pre-1987 secular (i.e., background) trend, peaked in the early 1990s, and almost returned to the secular trend by 1994. This rise and fall of IBM track with the pool of prevalent cases diagnosed within the prior 2 years. IBM for cases diagnosed with metastatic disease fell starting in 1991, while IBM for those diagnosed with localized/regional disease was relatively flat. CONCLUSIONS: The rise and fall in prostate cancer mortality observed since the introduction of PSA testing in the general population are consistent with a hypothesis that a fixed percent of the rising and falling pool of recently diagnosed patients who die of other causes may be mislabeled as dying of prostate cancer. The decline in IBM for distant stage disease and flat IBM trends for localized/regional disease provide some evidence of improved prognosis for screen-detected cases, although alternative interpretations are possible.}

It represents the predictive PDF as a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the forecasts' relative contributions to predictive skill over a training period. It was developed initially for quantities whose PDFs can be approximated by normal distributions, such as temperature and sea level pressure. BMA does not apply in its original form to precipitation, because the predictive PDF of precipitation is normormal in two major ways: it has a positive probability of being equal to zero, and it is skewed. In this study BMA is extended to probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasting. The predictive PDF corresponding to one ensemble member is a mixture of a discrete component at zero and a gamma distribution. Unlike methods that predict the probability of exceeding a threshold, BMA gives a full probability distribution for future precipitation. The method was applied to daily 48-h forecasts of 24-h accumulated precipitation in the North American Pacific Northwest in 2003-04 using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. It yielded predictive distributions that were calibrated and sharp. It also gave probability of precipitation forecasts that were much better calibrated than those based on consensus voting of the ensemble members. It gave better estimates of the probability of high-precipitation events than logistic regression on the cube root of the ensemble mean.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) trial showed that radical prostatectomy (RP) reduced prostate cancer deaths with an absolute mortality difference (AMD) between the RP and watchful waiting arms of 6.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2\% to 12.0\%) after 15 years. In the United States, the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) produced an AMD of 3\% (95\% CI = -1.1\% to 6.5\%) after 12 years. It is not known whether a higher frequency of screen detection in PIVOT explains the lower AMD.
METHODS: We assumed the SPCG-4 trial represents RP efficacy and prostate cancer survival in an unscreened population. Given the fraction of screen-detected prostate cancers in PIVOT, we adjusted prostate cancer survival using published estimates of overdiagnosis and lead time to project the effect of screen detection on disease-specific deaths.
RESULTS: On the basis of published estimates, we assumed that 32\% of screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed and a mean lead time among non-overdiagnosed cancers of 7.7 years. When we adjusted prostate cancer survival for the 76\% of case patients in PIVOT who were screen detected, we projected that the AMD after 12 years would be 2.0\% (95\% CI = -1.6\% to 5.6\%) based on variation in published estimates of overdiagnosis and mean lead time in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: If RP efficacy and prostate cancer survival in the absence of screening are similar to that in the SPCG-4 trial, then overdiagnosis and lead time largely explain the lower AMD in PIVOT. If these artifacts of screening are the correct explanation, then there is a subset of case subjects that should not be treated with RP, and identifying this subset should lead to a clearer understanding of the benefit of RP in the remaining cases.},

In the lung cancer study, we found an inverse dose-response effect for total vitamin A intake in males only, with an odds ratio of 1.8 (P less than .05) for the lowest intake quartile relative to the highest; we found no association for ascorbic acid. In the bladder cancer study, we found lower (but not statistically significant) mean intakes of both vitamins in patients compared with controls, with the effect stronger for ascorbic acid. In the prostate cancer study, no effect was detected for total vitamin A or ascorbic acid in men less than 70 years old, but a direct association of vitamin A only with a dose-response gradient was found for men 70 years or older (odds ratio = 1.87; P less than .05, for the highest relative to the lowest intake quartile). Our findings at present indicate that vitamin A has a protective effect against lung and bladder cancers but not against prostate cancer and that ascorbic acid has a protective effect against bladder cancer as well. In our later analyses, we will examine the possibility that the effects of vitamin A vary with histologic type and that this may account for the lack of an association with lung cancer in women.}

DESIGN: T cell subsets and cell-mediated responses were analysed at baseline and after 12 months of either a double or a triple antiretroviral therapy in 26 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 T cell counts {\textgreater} 500 x 10(6) cells/l and a baseline plasma viral load {\textgreater} 10000 copies/ml. RESULTS: Triple therapy was significantly more effective in reducing plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels, in returning CD4:CD8 ratio to nearly normal levels, in reducing activated cells (CD38) and in increasing naive (CD45RA+CD45RO-) and memory (CD45RA-CD45RO+) CD4 cells. Both double and triple therapies caused a clear decrease in memory (CD45RA-CD45RO+) CD8 cells as well as a significant increase in the CD28 subset of CD8 cells. At baseline, there was an important increase in cells producing interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) with no significant abnormalities in T lymphocytes producing interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 4. Both types of therapy reduced IFNgamma- and IL2-producing CD4 T lymphocytes while IFNgamma-producing CD8 cells remained increased. Even before therapy, these HIV-1-positive patients lacked significant abnormalities in the T cell responsiveness to polyclonal stimuli as well as in the secretion of CCR5 chemokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy at very early stages of chronic HIV-1 infection allows rapid and almost complete normalization of T cell subsets and preservation of T cell functions. These early-treated patients could be excellent candidates for receiving additional HIV-specific immune-based therapies, which might be essential for the control of HIV infection.}

This article reviews what we know about cervical cancer in elderly women to provide clinicians with the background necessary for assessments of screening recommendations, integration of new data into practice, and development of consensus approaches to screening in the elderly. Two central questions that affect a screening program for the elderly are how long the neoplastic process takes from preinvasive disease to the development of invasive cancer, and how likely is it that a given neoplastic state observed in an elderly woman will, in fact, progress to a more severe state. The ultimate success of the new Medicare benefit will also be affected by the use of Papanicolaou testing, the technique of obtaining the smear, and the adequacy of reporting and follow-up. The expansion of Medicare benefits to include early cervical cancer detection has the potential to improve the quality and the duration of older women's lives.}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, all new cases of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland were intended to be registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR). This register contains information on diagnosing unit, date of diagnosis, cause of diagnosis, tumor grade, tumor stage according to the TNM classification in force, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis and primary treatment given within the first 6 months after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 72,028 patients were registered, comprising {\textgreater}97\% of all pertinent incident cases of prostate cancer in the Swedish Cancer Register (SCR). During the study period there was a considerable decrease in median age at the time of diagnosis, a stage migration towards smaller tumors, a decrease in median serum PSA values at diagnosis, a decrease in the age-standardized incidence rate of men diagnosed with distant metastases or with a PSA level of {\textgreater} 100 ng/ml at diagnosis and an increase in the proportion of tumors with Gleason score or =75 years than in those aged {\textless}75 years. Also, the pattern of endocrine treatment varied in different parts of Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: All changes in the register seen over time are consistent with increased diagnostic activity, especially PSA testing, resulting in an increased number of cases with early disease, predominantly tumors in category T1c. The patterns of diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer vary considerably in different parts of Sweden. The NPCR continues to be an important source for research, epidemiological surveillance of the incidence, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.}

This analysis takes into account the patterns of exposure to radon and cigarette smoke experienced by individuals in the cohort. A simultaneous re-analysis of the British doctors' cohort indicated that those model parameters relating to the effects of tobacco were comparable in the two data sets. We found no evidence of interaction between radon and tobacco smoke with respect to their joint effect on the first or second stage mutation rates or on the rate of proliferation of initiated cells. The age-specific relative risks associated with joint exposure to radon and cigarette smoke, however, were supra-additive but submultiplicative. The analysis also confirmed that fractionation of radon exposures leads to higher lung cancer risks.

Mortality rates (per million per year) were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population, and proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated by occupation and industry, and adjusted for age, sex, and race. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate was 11.52, with males (22.34) showing a sixfold higher rate than females (3.94). Geographic distribution of mesothelioma mortality is predominantly coastal. Occupations with significantly elevated PMRs included plumbers/pipefitters and mechanical engineers. Industries with significantly elevated PMRs included ship and boat building and repairing, and industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These surveillance findings can be useful in generating hypotheses and developing strategies to prevent mesothelioma.}

We investigated the extent to which the timing of progression to AIDS can be explained solely in terms of decline of the CD4 lymphocyte count in 111 haemophiliacs followed for up to 11 years since infection with HIV. A median of 10 CD4 lymphocyte counts were made per patient. By applying a simple linear model for the decline in CD4 lymphocyte counts over time, we estimated the date of development of AIDS in 96 patients who had at least 5 determinations. 84\% (81 of 96) of patients were correctly classified as to development of AIDS before Jan 1, 1990 (p less than 0.0001), with this model. The results suggest that differences in the time at which patients with HIV will progress to AIDS can largely be explained by differences in rates of decline of CD4 lymphocyte counts},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Based on observed numbers of incident mesotheliomas since 1972, to predict future numbers in men in New South Wales. METHODS The incidence of mesothelioma was modelled in two ways. First by using an age/birth cohort model, and second by using a model based on potential exposure to asbestos in terms of age and calendar year. The latter model included a term for clearance of asbestos fibres from the lungs, and a term for diagnostic fraction. The age and calendar year model was based on the model introduced by Hodgson and colleagues but replaced piecewise effects by smooth functions represented by cubic splines. RESULTS The number of mesotheliomas between 2004 and 2060 was predicted as 6690 with the age-cohort model and as 6779 by the age and calendar year model, with peak annual numbers of 187 in the year 2021 and 196 in the year 2014 with the two models respectively. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of parameter estimates in the two models was in accord with the known use of amphibole asbestos in Australia. The predicted peak year of 2014-21 is 30-35 years after the phasing out of amphibole use, and this period is in accord with predictions for the UK and the US; in the latter country the peak was 10-15 years earlier corresponding to a marked decline of amphibole use in and following the 1960s.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-fatal health outcomes from diseases and injuries are a crucial consideration in the promotion and monitoring of individual and population health. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs).
METHODS: Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis.
FINDINGS: Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350,000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient -0·37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa.
INTERPRETATION: Rates of YLDs per 100,000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.

Comparison subjects consisted of 996 former workers known to be alive in Western Australia in 1990 who did not join the program. Program subjects were provided with annual supplies of vitamin A (either synthetic beta-carotene or retinol), help in quitting smoking and dietary advice. The comparison group received only mail contact. Both groups were followed up to December 1994 for vital status and cancer information, and rates of cancer and death from various causes were compared. Mortality in both groups was higher than expected (standardised mortality ratio 1.23 in program subjects and 1.67 in comparison subjects). After adjustment for age, smoking and asbestos exposure, the relative rates in participants compared with non-participants was below I for all examined cancers and causes of death. For mesothelioma and lung cancer, group differences increased with time from entry, whereas other differences dissipated with time. No significant side effects were reported. In conclusion, program participants had significantly lower mortality than non-participants, but the rates of the 2 groups converged with time.}

The authors retrospectively compared the development of CAN in recipients of cadaveric (CAD), living-related donor (LRD), and living-unrelated donor (LURD) transplants at their center. METHODS: The authors retrospectively examined the impact of various factors on the incidence of CAN using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards analysis in a single-center kidney transplant population. RESULTS: Between 1 January 1990 and 31 May 2000, 2,140 kidney-alone transplants were performed at the authors' center. The overall 5-year incidence of biopsy-proven CAN was 12.2\% (n=203). Risk factors for CAN included the number of transplants (P=0.0001), acute rejection (P=0.0001), panel reactive antibody (P=0.0001), discharge creatinine (P=0.0001), 1-year creatinine (P=0.0015), delayed graft function (P=0.007), total human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B and -DR mismatches (P=0.0005), recipient age (P=0.003), black donor race (P=0.001), black recipient race (0.0457), donor age (P=0.0053), cold storage time (P=0.019), and cytomegalovirus infections (P=0.002). Interestingly, although the LRD HLA-identical recipients had a significantly lower incidence of CAN (P=0.0015), the incidence of CAN in CAD and HLA-nonidentical LRD recipients did not differ. Graft survival was significantly worse in CAD recipients compared with all other groups (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the importance of immunologic and nonimmunologic factors on the development of CAN. The disparities in overall graft survival, despite the similarities in CAN rates, suggests that other factors, in addition to CAN, influence the increase in graft loss in CAD transplant recipients.}

Six cases of cervical neoplasia were detected. The crude prevalence OR among women with human papillomavirus infection was 18.3 (95\% CI: 1.94, 121.0). Women who reported ever having used birth control also had a significantly increased crude and adjusted risk of cervical cancer, although this variable likely was a proxy measure for sexual behavior. In the logistic regression model, the adjusted prevalence ORs of disease among human papillomavirus-positive women and among women reporting any postmenopausal bleeding were significantly increased. Confidence intervals for adjusted results, however, were wide because of the small number of cases and the low prevalence of some exposures. More studies with larger samples are needed to determine whether accepted risk factors for whites are also associated with cervical neoplasia among black, elderly women.}

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 3488 women with a community-based ASCUS interpretation were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy, triage that was based on enrollment HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology at a colposcopy referral threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or conservative management based on repeat cytology at a referral threshold of HSIL. All arms included 2 years of semiannual follow-up and colposcopy at exit. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was offered to women with histologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 at any visit or persistent CIN grade 1 at exit. The study end point was 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3. RESULTS: The 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3 was 8\% to 9\% in all study arms. The immediate colposcopy strategy yielded 53.6\% sensitivity for cumulative cases of CIN grade 3 diagnosed over 2 years. The human papillomavirus (HPV) triage strategy referred 55.6\% of women and detected 72.3\% of cumulative cases of CIN grade 3. A conservative management strategy of repeat cytology at the HSIL threshold referred 12.3\% of women while detecting 54.6\% of cumulative CIN grade 3. To compare triage tests, we re-estimated the performance of HPV and cytology in successfully referring women with underlying CIN grade 3 (ie, ignoring the insensitivity we discovered in colposcopically directed biopsies). A single enrollment HPV test identified 92.4\% of the women diagnosed with CIN grade 3. Serial cytology, even at an ASCUS threshold, would have required two visits to achieve similar sensitivity (95.4\%) and would have referred 67.1\% to colposcopy. CONCLUSION: HPV triage is at least as sensitive as immediate colposcopy for detecting CIN grade 3 and refers about half as many women to colposcopy. Follow-up that used repeat cytology is sensitive at an ASCUS referral threshold but requires two follow-up visits and ultimately more colposcopic examinations than HPV triage.}

METHODS: We studied 35 HIV-infected patients with late-stage disease who had therapy interruptions leading to high viral load levels, median greater than 750 000 RNA log10 copies/ml, and in whom two CD4 cell counts (median 28 days apart) were available before beginning a salvage regimen. RESULTS: Overall, there was a substantial decline in CD4 cell counts from a median of 125 to 83 cells/mm3 in the average 28 day period, with median proportionate and absolute losses of 26\% and 24 cells/mm3 per month, respectively (P {\textless} 0.008). This tended to be greater in individuals studied sooner after interrupting therapy (P = 0.03) and in those with CD4 cell counts above the pre-therapy baseline (P = 0.06). There was a strong negative correlation between the proportionate increase in viral load and the absolute change in CD4 cell count (-0.66, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Patients with relatively advanced HIV infection interrupting antiretroviral therapy after failing a protease inhibitor-containing regimen require frequent monitoring because CD4 cell counts appear to fall quite rapidly, at least in the first few weeks after interruption},

	annote = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of genital tract infections and cervical abnormalities in 185 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive outpatients with a view toward establishing an effective policy for gynecology screening. METHODS: Gynecology results were reviewed for 185 HIV-positive women seen as outpatients at the Royal Free Hospital in London. All subjects underwent screening for cervical abnormalities (smear and colposcopy) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) at 6-month intervals for 6 years. The STD prevalence was calculated, and the relationship between the occurrence of STDs and the demography and sexual lifestyle of the women was examined to determine whether these factors were predictive for women at risk for STDs. The incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was determined. We reviewed the use of colposcopy in addition to cytology as a primary screening test to see whether it improved the detection rate of CIN. RESULTS: Sixty-five (35.1\%) women had a history of previous STDs, and new STDs were detected in 18 women at their first visits. None were detected at subsequent visits. Sexual lifestyle details did not predict women at risk for STDs. Ninety-eight (53\%) cervical smears were reported as normal at the first visit, but there was a 3.1\% (95\% confidence interval 0, 6.6) false-negative rate when compared with colposcopy and directed biopsy. Five of fifty women (10\%) with CIN I had progressed to higher-grade lesions by 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low prevalence of STDs detected, except for initial screening at presentation, regular, repeat STD screening of HIV-positive women appears to be unnecessary. Because of the high incidence of cervical abnormalities, screening for cervical biopsy improved the detection rate of cervical abnormalities},

The observed time trends have been attributed to a change in the rate of cigarette smoking, changes in exposure to new environmental carcinogens, and changes in the criteria for the histopathologic diagnosis of lung cancer. The current study was designed to examine the incidence patterns of lung cancer by histologic type in Connecticut and to use this information to project the future trend of the disease in this population. METHODS. This study was based on all the lung cancer cases reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry between 1960 and 1989. On the basis of this data set, crude and age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer were calculated by histologic type for each sex. The age-specific incidence rates are presented by calendar year and cohort year of birth. A regression model was used to identify birth cohort, period, and age as determinants of the observed time trends. RESULTS. For the overall age-adjusted incidence rates, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma have stabilized in men, whereas they are still increasing in women. The incidence of adenocarcinoma has been increasing in both men and women, but there has been a much sharper incidence among females since the mid-1970s. An examination of age-specific incidence rates by birth cohort and the results from age-period-cohort modeling indicate that incidences of all three major histologic types of lung cancer in the recent birth cohorts either have started decreasing (squamous cell carcinoma) or shown a clear reduction in the rate of increase (adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma). This study, however, did not indicate an increase of bronchoalveolar lung carcinoma, which was reported by other clinically based studies. CONCLUSION. While the overall age-adjusted incidence rates showed different incidence patterns for different histologic types of lung cancer, a decreasing or stabilized rate for all three major histologic types of lung cancer was observed in recent birth cohorts in both males and females. The observed incidence pattern is consistent with smoking trends over time including changes in smoking prevalence and the consumption of low tar and filter cigarettes. It is expected that if the current trend in tobacco smoking continues and if there are no major changes in other risk factors for lung cancer, a forthcoming stabilization or decrease in the rate of lung cancer incidence for all major histologic types (including adenocarcinoma) in both sexes in Connecticut could be anticipated.}

	annote = {Graft rejection has been a problem after marrow grafts for patients with aplastic anemia who were conditioned with cyclophosphamide (CY). Rejection lessened when patients were given the marrow donor's peripheral blood buffy-coat cells in addition to the marrow, but this result was achieved at the price of more chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Results with second transplants suggested that CY alternating with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was more immunosuppressive than CY alone. Therefore, the current study explored CY and ATG without buffy-coat cell transfusions in 39 patients with aplastic anemia given marrow transplants from HLA-identical family members (siblings in 38 cases, father in 1 case). We hoped both to minimize the risks of graft rejection and of chronic GVHD and to improve survival. Patients were 2 to 52 years of age (median, 24.5); 87\% had received previous transfusions, and 41\% had therapy with immunosuppressive agents before transplant. They were administered four daily doses of CY (total, 200 mg/kg) alternating with three doses of ATG (total, 90 mg/kg) followed by an HLA-identical marrow graft. Methotrexate and cyclosporine were administered to prevent GVHD. Two patients rejected their grafts (5\%), and both were successfully retransplanted. Acute (grade 2 or 3) GVHD occurred in 15\% and chronic GVHD in 34\% of patients. The actuarial survival rate at 3 years was 92\%, which compares favorably to the 72\% survival rate in 39 historical patients who were matched with current patients for age and risk factors for rejection and GVHD. CY/ATG is a well-tolerated and effective conditioning program for marrow grafting in aplastic anemia that, when combined with GVHD prevention by methotrexate/cyclosporine, results in excellent survival.}

The objective of this study was to examine the distribution of bowel, breast and prostate cancer test use by place of birth and years since migration in a large population-based cohort study in Australia. METHODS: In 2006, screening status, country of birth and other demographic and health related factors were ascertained by self-completed questionnaire among 31,401 (16,126 women and 15,275 men) participants aged 50 or over from the 45 and Up Study in New South Wales. RESULTS: 35\% of women and 39\% of men reported having a bowel cancer test and 57\% of men reported having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, in the previous 5 years. 72\% of women reported having screening mammography in the previous 2 years. Compared to Australian-born women, women from East Asia, Southeast Asia, Continental Western Europe, and North Africa/Middle East had significantly lower rates of bowel testing, with odds ratios (OR; 95\%CI) ranging from 0.5 (0.4-0.7) to 0.7 (0.6-0.9); migrants from East Asia (0.5, 0.3-0.7) and North Africa/Middle East (0.5, 0.3-0.9) had significantly lower rates of mammography. Compared to Australian-born men, bowel cancer testing was significantly lower among men from all regions of Asia (OR, 95\%CI ranging from 0.4, 0.3-0.6 to 0.6, 0.5-0.9) and Continental Europe (OR, 95\%CI ranging from 0.4, 0.3-0.7 to 0.7, 0.6-0.9). Only men from East Asia had significantly lower PSA testing rates than Australian-born men (0.4, 0.3-0.6). As the number of years lived in Australia increased, cancer test use among migrants approached Australian-born rates. CONCLUSION: Certain migrant groups within the population may require targeted intervention to improve their uptake of cancer screening, particularly screening for bowel cancer.},

It is proposed that generalized additive models (GAMs) are practical for cancer rate prediction. Smooth equivalents for classical age-period, age-cohort, and age-period-cohort models are available using one-dimensional smoothing splines. We also propose using two-dimensional smoothing splines for age and period. Variance estimation can be based on the bootstrap. To assess predictive performance, we compared the models with a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. Model comparison used cross-validation and measures of predictive performance for recent predictions. The models were applied to data from the World Health Organization Mortality Database for females in five countries. Model choice between the age-period-cohort models and the two-dimensional models was equivocal with respect to cross-validation, while the two-dimensional GAMs had very good predictive performance. The Bayesian model performed poorly due to imprecise predictions and the assumption of linearity outside of observed data. In summary, the two-dimensional GAM performed well. The GAMs make the important prediction that female lung cancer rates in these countries will be stable or begin to decline in the future.}

Of 17 evaluable patients, all had evidence of sustained marrow engraftment. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 500/microL was 15 days for patients receiving FK506 alone or FK506 plus methylprednisolone and 23 days for FK506 plus short MTX. Pharmacokinetic studies did not show any significant difference in clearance of FK506 when administered alone or in combination with methylprednisolone or MTX. The mean bioavailability after oral administration in these same three groups was 0.49 +/- 0.1, 0.27 +/- 0.12, and 0.16 +/- 0.08, respectively (P = .003). The decrease in bioavailability may have resulted from an exacerbation of radiation-induced gastroenteritis by MTX. The most significant adverse effect associated with the administration of FK506 was nephrotoxicity, which occurred in 14 of 18 patients (78\%). The mean glomerular filtration rate, determined by clearance of (99MTc)DTPA, decreased to 56\% (+/- 18\%) of the pretransplant baseline level by week 8 (P = .002). Eight of 18 patients (44\%) developed grades II-IV acute GVHD, predominantly of the skin and gastrointestinal tract. The actuarial probability of transplant-related mortality during the first 100 days was 24\%. The actuarial probability of 1-year disease-free survival was 39\%. In conclusion, although bioavailability of FK506 may be affected in patients receiving MTX, this study suggests that FK506 may have a role in the management of patients after allogeneic marrow transplantation.}

To the authors' knowledge, the application of HPV testing to ASCUS smears in routine practice with comparison of probabilistic and interpretive models of cytologic reporting has not been reported. METHODS: HPV DNA testing was performed reflexively on 216 liquid-based Pap smears that initially were interpreted as ASCUS. According to the interpretive model, ASCUS interpretations were modified and reported as either low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) when HPV positive and as reactive when HPV negative. Using the probabilistic model, ASCUS interpretations were maintained and simply reported with the HPV test result. Histologic follow-up data were obtained. RESULTS: Of the 216 women with ASCUS cytology, 142 (65.7\%) were positive for high-risk HPV types. Of the 142 HPV-positive ASCUS smears, 101 (71.1\%) were modified to an interpretation of LSIL (96 cases) or SIL (5 cases). Histologic follow-up of 55 of the 101 HPV-positive smears in the interpretive group and 26 of the 41 HPV-positive smears in the probabilistic group yielded similar percentages of lesions (18 lesions [32.7\%] and 9 lesions [34.6\%], respectively). However, there was a preponderance of low-grade lesions in the interpretive group (89\%) but a nearly equal distribution of low-grade and high-grade lesions in the probabilistic group (56\% and 44\%, respectively); overall, 22\% of the lesions were high-grade. Of the 74 HPV-negative ASCUS smears, 71 (96\%) were modified to reactive and all 5 with histologic follow-up were judged as negative. CONCLUSIONS: Colposcopy with tissue studies was virtually restricted to HPV-positive cases, regardless of the reporting model used, suggesting that clinicians are basing colposcopy triage on the HPV test result rather than the definitiveness of the cytologic interpretation. This observation, the similar yield of lesions in both groups, and the significant risk of high-grade lesions argue against application of the interpretive model to HPV-tested ASCUS cases.}

Radiographs were recovered for 83\% of the men and read independently by two observers. By means of logistic regression analysis a current prevalence of parenchymal abnormality (defined as a radiographic profusion of small opacities of category 1/0 or greater on the ILO classification) of nearly 20\% was calculated after adjustment for age, time since first exposure, and cumulative exposure level. One hundred men randomly selected from those known to be alive in the sample were invited to attend for a new radiographic examination. Seventy four men attended and the predicted prevalence was confirmed. It is estimated from these data that there were between 450 and 900 former Wittenoom workers in Australia at the end of 1980 who had radiographic abnormality consistent with pneumoconiosis but had not claimed compensation or had asbestosis diagnosed. The data are consistent with there being no threshold dose of crocidolite exposure for the development of radiographic abnormality in this group.}

Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between predictor variables and the risk of suicide, with the focus on migrant status and area of residence. A significantly higher risk of suicide was found in male migrants from Northern Europe and Eastern Europe/former USSR, compared to Australian-born males; a significantly lower suicide risk occurred in males from Southern Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In female migrants, those from UK/Eire, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe/former USSR and New Zealand exhibited a significantly higher risk of suicide compared to Australian-born females. A significantly lower risk of suicide occurred in females from the Middle East. Male migrants overall were at significantly lower risk of suicide than the Australian-born, while female migrants overall had a significantly higher risk of suicide than Australian-born females. Among migrant males overall, the rural-urban suicide risk differential was significantly higher for those living in non-metropolitan areas (RR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.7-2.1). Suicide risk was significantly higher in non-metropolitan male immigrants from the UK/Eire (RR = 1.4; 95\% CI: 1.1-1.7), Southern Europe (RR = 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.2-2.4), Northern/Western Europe (1.5; 95\% CI: 1.2-1.9), the Middle East (RR = 3.8; 95\% CI: 1.9-7.8), New Zealand (RR = 1.4; 95\% CI: 1.0-1.8) and 'other' (RR = 2.6; 95\% CI: 1.9-3.5), when compared to their urban counterparts. There was no statistically significant difference in suicide risk between rural and urban Australian-born males. For female suicide, significantly lower risk was found in female immigrants living in non-metropolitan areas who were from Northern/Western Europe (RR = 0.7; 95\% CI: 0.4-0.96), as well as the Australian-born (RR = 0.7; 95\% CI: 0.6-0.8), when compared to their urban counterparts. The non-metropolitan/metropolitan relative risk for suicide in female migrants overall was not significantly different from one. Among male youth there was a significantly higher suicide risk in non-metropolitan areas, with a relative risk estimate of 1.4 for Australian-born youth (95\% CI: 1.2-1.5) and 1.7 for migrant youth (95\% CI: 1.2-2.4), when compared with metropolitan counterparts. We conclude that suicide among migrant males living in non-metropolitan areas accounts for most of the excess of male suicide in rural NSW, and the significantly lower risk of suicide for non-metropolitan Australian-born women does not apply to migrant women.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) has shown significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality after 9 years and 11 years of follow-up, but screening is controversial because of adverse events such as overdiagnosis. We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to 2010, with analyses truncated at 9, 11, and 13 years.
METHODS: ERSPC is a multicentre, randomised trial with a predefined centralised database, analysis plan, and core age group (55-69 years), which assesses prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in eight European countries. Eligible men aged 50-74 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention (control). Investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group. Analysis was by intention to treat. We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation. Only incidence and no mortality data at 9 years' follow-up are reported for the French centres. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN49127736.
FINDINGS: With data truncated at 13 years of follow-up, 7408 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and 6107 cases in the control group. The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1·91 (95\% CI 1·83-1·99) after 9 years (1·64 [1·58-1·69] including France), 1·66 (1·60-1·73) after 11 years, and 1·57 (1·51-1·62) after 13 years. The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was 0·85 (0·70-1·03) after 9 years, 0·78 (0·66-0·91) after 11 years, and 0·79 (0·69-0·91) at 13 years. The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 13 years was 0·11 per 1000 person-years or 1·28 per 1000 men randomised, which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per 781 (95\% CI 490-1929) men invited for screening or one per 27 (17-66) additional prostate cancer detected. After adjustment for non-participation, the rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was 0·73 (95\% CI 0·61-0·88).
INTERPRETATION: In this update the ERSPC confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of PSA, with a substantially increased absolute effect at 13 years compared with findings after 9 and 11 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening.

The number of incident cancer cases by sex and site in Finland was predicted using a prediction interval for each year from 1967 to 2003 on the basis of historical cancer incidence data obtained 5 to 15 years earlier. Cancer sites where major human-made changes in aetiology and diagnostics had occurred were analysed separately. Assuming that such changes had not occurred, the 95\% prediction intervals based on normal errors of the age-standardised rate and on Poisson models included the observed number in 65-100\% of the years. The Poisson models produced, on average, shorter intervals and were more capable of indicating a site where the model assumptions did not hold true. Simple extrapolation models may be used with some caution on coverage when there are no known factors that might make abrupt changes in the temporal development of cancer incidence. On the other hand, they may be used for detecting the effects of such factors.}

Data on occupation and smoking habits were collected from national surveys during 1965-1980. The relationship between smoking habits and lung cancer incidence was estimated on aggregated level using data from 12 occupational groups that were initially assumed not to be exposed to occupational lung carcinogens. The estimated relationship was used to control confounding from smoking in the other groups. The results were presented as smoking-adjusted incidence ratios.Results: A significant excess risk was found for 26 groups. It was estimated that about 20\% of all lung cancer among men could be related to occupation after adjusting for the effect of smoking.Conclusions: Our method provided a clearer picture of the occupational risk and could be useful in other situations where individual information on smoking habits is lacking.}

To investigate the associations between commonly consumed flavonoid compounds and lung cancer, the authors conducted a population-based case-control study of 558 lung cancer cases and a group of 837 controls. METHODS: Dietary intakes of flavonoids were estimated by combining the intake frequency (collected by a food frequency questionnaire), portion size, and food composition data. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence limits (95\% CLs) with an adjustment for potential confounders, including age, sex, race-ethnicity, years of schooling, smoking status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, and daily energy intake. RESULTS: Lung cancer was associated inversely with the consumption of epicatechin (in 10 mg per day increment: OR, 0.64; 95\% CL, 0.46-0.88), catechin (4 mg per day increment: OR, 0.49; 95\% CL, 0.35-0.70), quercetin (9 mg per day increment: OR, 0.65; 95\% CL, 0.44-0.95), and kaempferol (2 mg per day increment: OR, 0.68; 95\% CL, 0.51-0.90) among tobacco smokers. There was little association between lung cancer and the flavonoid compounds mentioned above among nonsmokers. Regardless of smoking status, there was little association with total flavonoids: thearubigins, hesperetin, naringenin, and myricetin. In addition, consumption of vegetables, tea, and wine, all of which are rich sources of flavonoids, was associated inversely with lung cancer among tobacco smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Certain flavonoid compounds, including epicatechin, catechin, quercetin, and kaempferol, were associated inversely with lung cancer among tobacco smokers, but not among nonsmokers. Further studies of these associations may be warranted.}

Variants of the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) gene have been linked to both hereditary and sporadic prostate cancer, although the evidence is inconclusive. Most studies have been conducted on Caucasians. The role of MSR1 in prostate cancer development among Asians, for whom rates of prostate cancer are low but rising rapidly, is unclear. To further evaluate the relationship between MSR1 variants and prostate cancer risk, we sequenced all 11 MSR1 exons, exon-intron junctions, promoter regions, as well as 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in 86 individuals from Shanghai, China. We identified a total of 21 sequence variants, including three novel variants that have not been reported previously. To balance genotyping cost and the capacity to capture sufficient genetic variation, we genotyped 4 haplotype tagging variants (P275A, INDEL7, P346P, and 3'UTR 70006), which capture 85\% of the genetic variation in MSR1 in this population. These four variants, plus two other variants (PRO3 and INDEL1) that have been linked to prostate cancer risk in previous studies, were typed for all study subjects, which included 130 prostate cancer cases, 130 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 150 controls randomly selected from the population. Three of the 6 variants were associated with prostate cancer. Men with a P346P (a novel variant) G allele (AG+GG) had a significantly reduced risk of total prostate cancer (OR=0.47, 95\% 0.23-0.96), while those with a P275A G allele had a 37\% reduced risk of prostate cancer (95\% CI 0.39-1.02), with more pronounced reduction in risk seen for localized cancer cases (OR=0.25, 95\% CI 0.12-0.52, p=0.001). In addition, men with the INDEL7 variant had a 67\% reduced risk of localized cancer (95\% CI 0.16-0.68). Based on the four tagging variants, we inferred four major haplotypes which account for over 90\% of the haplotype variation in this population. The haplotype frequencies were significantly different between localized prostate cancer cases and controls, with a global p value of 0.004, and the haplotype containing the minor alleles of the P275A and INDEL7 variants was associated with a significantly reduced risk of localized prostate cancer (OR=0.28, 95\% CI 0.13-0.59), relative to the most common haplotype. These results, although modest and largely confined to localized prostate cancer, suggest that MSR1 polymorphisms may play a role in prostate cancer etiology in Chinese men. The role of MSR1 warrants further investigation in larger studies and other populations.}

We introduce a new method for picking prior distributions, and propose a number of refinements of previously used models. We also consider ecological bias, mutual standardization, and choice of both spatial model and prior specification. We analyze male lip cancer incidence data collected in Scotland over the period 1975-1980, and outline a number of problems with previous analyses of these data. In disease mapping studies, hierarchical models can provide robust estimation of area-level risk parameters, though care is required in the choice of covariate model, and it is important to assess the sensitivity of estimates to the spatial model chosen, and to the prior specifications on the variance parameters. Spatial ecological regression is a far more hazardous enterprise for two reasons. First, there is always the possibility of ecological bias, and this can only be alleviated by the inclusion of individual-level data. For the Scottish data, we show that the previously used mean model has limited interpretation from an individual perspective. Second, when residual spatial dependence is modeled, and if the exposure has spatial structure, then estimates of exposure association parameters will change when compared with those obtained from the independence across space model, and the data alone cannot choose the form and extent of spatial correlation that is appropriate.}

We made an empirical comparison of different versions of this model, using data from cancer registries in the Nordic countries for the period 1958-1997. We have applied 15 different methods to 20 sites for each sex in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Median absolute value of the relative difference between observed and predicted numbers of cases for these 160 combinations of site, sex and country was calculated. The medians varied between 10.4 per cent and 15.3 per cent in predictions 10 years ahead, and between 15.1 per cent and 32.0 per cent for 20 year predictions. We have four main conclusions: (i) projecting current trends worked better than assuming that future rates are equal to present rates; (ii) the method based on the multiplicative APC model often overestimated the number of cancer cases due to its exponential growth over time, but using a power function to level off this growth improved the predictions; (iii) projecting only half of the trend after the first 10 years also gave better long-term predictions; (iv) methods that emphasize trends in the last decade seem to perform better than those that include earlier time trends.}

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that a substantial proportion of women with HIV infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland have experienced no other diagnosed STD and to describe the demographic, clinical and social factors associated with the occurrence of other STD in a cohort of HIV infected women. METHOD: Analysis of cross-sectional baseline data from a prospective study of 505 women with diagnosed HIV infection. The setting was 15 HIV treatment centres in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The main outcome measures were occurrence of other STD diagnosed for the first time before and after HIV diagnosis. Data were obtained from interview with women and clinic notes. We particularly focused on occurrence of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis after HIV diagnosis, as these are the STD most likely to reflect recent unprotected sexual intercourse. RESULTS: The women were mainly infected via heterosexual sex (n = 304), and injection drug use (n = 174). 151 were black Africans. A total of 250 (49.5\%) women reported never having been diagnosed with an STD apart from HIV, 255 (50.5\%) women had ever experienced an STD besides HIV, including 109 (21.6\%) who had their first other STD diagnosed after HIV. Twenty-five (5\%) women reported having had chlamydia, gonorrhoea or trichomoniasis diagnosed for the first time after HIV diagnosis, possibly reflecting unprotected sexual intercourse since HIV diagnosis. In all 301 (60\%) women reported having had sex with a man in the 6 months prior to entry to the study. Of these, 168 (58\%) reported using condoms 'always', 66(23\%) 'sometimes' and 56 (19\%) 'never'. CONCLUSIONS: Half the women in this study reported having never experienced any other diagnosed STD besides HIV. However, after HIV diagnosis most women remain sexually active and at least 5\% had an STD diagnosed which reflect unprotected sexual intercourse},

Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events.

RESULTS: We observed associations that were generally consistent with previous reports, including associations of bone and joint implants with connective-tissue diseases, and an association of penile implants with idiopathic progressive neuropathy. We also observed associations of breast implants and pacemakers with connective-tissue diseases. CONCLUSIONS: For the most part, our study confirms our previous case-control results.

In practice, however, the gold standard may be too costly or invasive to be applied to all subjects, in which case a two-phase design is often employed. Phase 1 data consisting of inexpensive and non-invasive screening tests on all study subjects are used to determine the subjects that receive the gold standard in the second phase. Naive estimates of prevalence in two-phase studies can be biased (verification bias). Imputation and re-weighting estimators are often used to avoid this bias. We contrast the forms and attributes of the various prevalence estimators. Distribution theory and simulation studies are used to investigate their bias and efficiency. We conclude that the semiparametric efficient approach is the preferred method for prevalence estimation in two-phase studies. It is more robust and comparable in its efficiency to imputation and other re-weighting estimators. It is also easy to implement. We use this approach to examine the prevalence of depression in adolescents with data from the Great Smoky Mountain Study.},

METHODS: Data for this study came from 3341 participants in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who, based on biopsies at the end of the study, were free of prostate carcinoma. Linear regression was used to assess associations of age, race, smoking, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, diet, and supplement use with PSA concentration during the second year of the trial, and linear mixed models were used to assess associations of these factors with PSA velocity (the percentage increase in PSA per year) during 6 years of the trial. RESULTS: Between the group of men ages 50-59 years and the group of men age 70 years and older, mean PSA increased by 0.22 ng/mL, and PSA velocity decreased by 1.2 percentage points (both P {\textless} 0.001). The PSA level among men who had a BMI {\textgreater} or = 35 kg/cm(2) was 0.20 ng/mL lower than the PSA level among men who had a BMI {\textless} 25 kd/cm(2) (P {\textless} 0.001), but BMI was not associated with PSA velocity. PSA velocity was 1.2 percentage points higher in African-American men compared with white men (P = 0.043). Low energy intake and the use of high-dose calcium supplements were associated with significantly lower PSA velocity (both P = 0.05). Weight gain also was associated with lower PSA velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in PSA concentration associated with demographic and lifestyle characteristics were small and were not likely to bias the interpretation of a single PSA test. Age, race, energy intake, calcium supplement use, and weight change were associated with substantial differences in PSA velocity, and the clinical interpretation of PSA velocity may be biased by these factors.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Swedish snus is a smokeless tobacco product that has been suggested as a tobacco harm reduction product. Our aim was to assess the potential population health effects of snus.


METHODS

We assessed the potential population health effects of snus in Australia with multistate life tables to estimate the difference in health-adjusted life expectancy between people who have never been smokers and various trajectories of tobacco use, including switching from smoking to snus use; and the potential for net population-level harm given different rates of snus uptake by current smokers, ex-smokers, and people who have never smoked.


FINDINGS

There was little difference in health-adjusted life expectancy between smokers who quit all tobacco and smokers who switch to snus (difference of 0.1-0.3 years for men and 0.1-0.4 years for women). For net harm to occur, 14-25 ex-smokers would have to start using snus to offset the health gain from every smoker who switched to snus rather than continuing to smoke. Likewise, 14-25 people who have never smoked would need to start using snus to offset the health gain from every new tobacco user who used snus rather than smoking.


INTERPRETATION

Current smokers who switch to using snus rather than continuing to smoke can realise substantial health gains. Snus could produce a net benefit to health at the population level if it is adopted in sufficient numbers by inveterate smokers. Relaxing current restrictions on the sale of snus is more likely to produce a net benefit than harm, with the size of the benefit dependent on how many inveterate smokers switch to snus.},

Simultaneously, both distant stage incidence and disease-specific mortality have fallen in the United States. A recent study suggests that if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing explains the decline in distant stage incidence, then it may be largely responsible for the decline in mortality. The objective was to quantify this link between PSA screening and the decline in distant stage incidence. METHODS: A fixed-cohort simulation model of prostate cancer progression and screening was adapted to a population-based model that integrates new data on trends in testing and biopsy practices. The model was calibrated to pre-PSA incidence and then screening was superimposed, obtaining incidence projections in the absence and presence of testing. This approach permits calculation of clinically relevant measures for model validation and direct assessment of the role of testing in the distant stage incidence decline. RESULTS: The model validated well with prior studies of natural history, and the sensitivity analysis indicated that the findings were robust to variation in model parameters. Model results indicate that PSA screening accounts for approximately 80\% of the observed decline in distant stage incidence. CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening contributed to the observed declines in distant stage incidence and mortality in the 1990s. However, additional factors, such as increasing awareness of prostate cancer and advances in treatment, have probably also played a role in these trends.},

DESIGN: A mathematical model of the clinical course of precancerous lesions which accounts for the influence of infection with the human papillomavirus, the effects of screening on the progression of disease, and the accuracy of the testing procedures. Two policies are compared: one in which women are withdrawn from the programme if their current smear is negative and they have a recent history of regular, negative results and one in which women are withdrawn if their current smear test is negative and a simultaneous test is negative for exposure to high risk types of human papillomavirus. SETTING: United Kingdom cervical screening programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of invasive cervical cancer and the use of resources. RESULTS: Early withdrawal of selected women from the programme is predicted to give rise to resource savings of up to 25\% for smear tests and 18\% for colposcopies when withdrawal occurs from age 50, the youngest age considered in the study. An increase in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer, by up to 2 cases/100 000 women each year is predicted. Testing for human papillomavirus infection to determine which women should be withdrawn from the programme makes little difference to outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This model systematically analyses the consequences of screening options using available data and the clinical course of precancerous lesions. If further audit studies confirm the model's forecasts, a policy of early withdrawal might be considered. This would be likely to release substantial resources which could be channelled into other aspects of health care or may be more effectively used within the cervical screening programme to counteract the possible increase in cancer incidence that early withdrawal might bring.}

	annote = {A recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical cancers worldwide contain human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an underestimate, due to sample inadequacy or integration events affecting the HPV L1 gene, which is the target of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test which was used. The formerly HPV-negative cases from this study have therefore been reanalyzed for HPV serum antibodies and HPV DNA. Serology for HPV 16 VLPs, E6, and E7 antibodies was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were HPV-negative and a sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were HPV-positive in the original study. Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative biopsies were also reanalyzed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7 PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate ( p{\textless} 0.001). Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99.7 per cent. The presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancer. The extreme rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical cytology in routine cervical screening.}

A total of 1106 subjects were selected. Each subject's age, cumulative exposure to crocidolite, and time since first exposure were determined from employment records, the results of a survey of airborne concentrations of fibres {\textgreater} 5 mu in length conducted in 1966, and an exposure rating by an industrial hygienist and an ex-manager of the mine and mill at Wittenoom. By the end of 1986 193 subjects had died. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the relative risk of death in five separate case-control analyses in which the outcomes were deaths from: (1) all causes, (2) malignant mesothelioma, (3) lung cancer, (4) asbestosis, and (5) other causes excluding cancer and asbestosis. Up to 20 controls per case were randomly chosen from all men of the same age who were not known to have died before the date of death of the index case. After adjustment for exposure and time since first exposure, there were significant and independent effects of radiographic profusion and pleural thickening on all cause mortality. The effect of profusion was largely a result of the effect on mortality from malignant mesothelioma and asbestosis but not lung cancer. The effect of pleural thickening was greatest on mortality from other causes, mainly ischaemic heart disease. This study has shown that degree of radiographic abnormality has an independent effect on mortality from malignant mesothelioma, asbestosis, and all causes even after allowing for the effects of age, degree of exposure, and time since first exposure.}

The 193 SIDS cases identified in the cohort were analyzed with 1930 controls randomly selected from infants who survived the first year of life. After adjustment for maternal age, infants born to mothers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day and who were anemic (hematocrit less than 30\%) during pregnancy were at a much higher risk of SIDS than infants born to mothers who did not smoke and were not anemic (odds ratio = 4.0; 95\% confidence limits, 2.1 and 7.4). Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day vs none increased the risk of SIDS by 70\% among women with hematocrit at or above 30\% but increased risk threefold among women with hematocrit below 30\%. After adjustment for more potential confounders in a logistic regression model, the effect of smoking on SIDS continued to increase with lower levels of hematocrit during pregnancy. Birth weight accounted for very little of these associations. Low hematocrit was not a risk factor for SIDS among nonsmokers but became an important predictor among heavy smokers. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that chronic fetal hypoxia may predispose to SIDS, possibly by impairing the normal development of the fetal central nervous system.}

Cohort and period trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates in Scotland were investigated using contrasts that measure the changes in the linear trends. These contrasts were compared with estimates obtained from mortality rates in the USA and Japan. A significant moderation of both breast cancer incidence and mortality rates was observed in Scotland, associated with cohorts of women born after the Second World War compared with women born between the two world wars. The moderation of breast cancer mortality among cohorts born after 1925 compared with cohorts born before 1925 that was observed in the USA and Japan was also observed in this study. This moderation is not present in the incidence rates. The relative decline in the risk of breast cancer seen in younger cohorts seems to be contradictory to the temporal pattern present among breast cancer risk factors. It may well be that the alteration of eating patterns as a result of rationing in the wartime and immediate post-war period, and the subsequent influence on certain breast cancer risk factors probably produced by such changes, may have had some influence on the development of healthier girls and women. Such speculation could be addressed in a well-designed epidemiological study. There have been no changes in the mortality rate trends with period in Scotland, although the changes in the incidence rate trends with period are consistent with an increase in registration coverage.}

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between viral load and gender among individuals with known date of seroconversion. SETTING: Sixty infectious disease clinics in Italy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data collected at enrollment in a cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users and heterosexual contacts naive to antiretroviral therapy at enrollment (245 men; 170 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma HIV RNA concentrations, measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or signal amplification b-DNA assays before antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: Plasma HIV RNA concentrations were similar by age and exposure category (p =.80 and p =.39, respectively). Median viral load among women was roughly half that of men (p =.002). The association between viral load and gender remained significant after fitting a two-way analysis of variance (p =.03) and after adjusting for CD4 count, modality of HIV transmission, and age at enrollment in a regression model. Viral load was 0.27 log10 copies/ml (95\% confidence interval, 0.05-0.40; p =.01) lower in women (i.e., 50\% lower in the raw scale). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma HIV RNA concentrations were found to be lower among women, even when considering the duration of HIV infection. Compared with men, it is possible women should be given highly aggressive antiretroviral therapy at lower HIV-RNA concentrations},

Differentiation between subpleural fat and non-calcified pleural plaques is important clinically and medico-legally. This study aims to determine if apparent circumscribed pleural thickening on chest radiographs is related with obesity. METHODS: Surveillance chest x-rays of 693 former asbestos workers were read with the ILO classification. Subjects with costophrenic angle obliteration (n = 57) were analyzed separately. The remaining subjects were subdivided according to their body mass index (BMI): Group 1 {\textless} 26 kg/m(2); Group 2 26-30 kg/m(2); Group 3 {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, asbestos exposure, and profusion scores were evenly distributed. BMI of {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2) was associated with a higher prevalence of pleural thickening on CXR (Gp1 = 8.5\%; Gp2 = 9.3\%; Gp3 = 18.3\%). This relationship was strongest in the subgroups with 25-50\% of the lateral chest wall involved and pleural thickness of {\textless} 10 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity (BMI {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2)) is related to apparent circumscribed pleural thickening on CXR, especially thin ({\textless} 1 cm) shadows covering 25-50\% of the lateral chest wall.}

The cohort consists of 12,011 males working for the Yunnan Tin Corporation, with complete exposure records, who were initially surveyed in 1976 and followed through 1988.,Tobacco and arsenic dominate the attributable risk for lung cancer. Of 842 lung cancer deaths, 21.4\% are attributable to tobacco alone, 19.7\% to a combination of tobacco and arsenic, 15.8\% to arsenic alone, 11\% to a combination of arsenic and radon, 9.2\% to a combination of tobacco and radon, 8.7\% to combination of arsenic, tobacco and radon, 5.5\% to radon alone, and 8.7\% to background. The models indicate that arsenic, radon and tobacco increase cell division, death and malignant conversion of initiated cells, but with significant differences in net cell proliferation rates in response to the different exposures. Smoking a bamboo water pipe or a Chinese long stem pipe appears to confer less risk than cigarette use, given equivalent tobacco consumption. (C) 2001. by Radiation Research Society.}

A summary score of the number of deleterious genotypes from these genes was strongly associated with survival (P=.001).

Advanced androgen-independent CaP is a serious health problem with no effective treatment at present. Estrogens have been reported to inhibit the growth of CaP cells in androgen-free environments. Recent reports have shown that the prostatic epithelium and primary CaP cells express ERbeta, with decreased expression of ERbeta accompanying CaP progression. It has been proposed that ERbeta may play a role in the growth regulation of prostate cells. The targeting of ERs by selective ER modulators might be an effective method of treating advanced CaP. METHODS: The anti-ERbeta antibody GC17 was used in immunohistochemistry to characterize the expression of ERbeta in CaP metastasis specimens (n = 60) obtained from 20 patients who had died of CaP. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the association of ERbeta expression with clinical parameters, including prostate-specific antigen levels, radiotherapy, and estrogen exposure. RESULTS: Nuclear ERbeta staining was detected in all bone CaP metastases (33 of 33) and nonosseous CaP metastases (27 of 27). However, a large variability in the percentage of immunoreactive cells (5\% to 100\%) was found among patients, as well as among individual patient samples. A statistically significant negative association between nuclear ERbeta staining and estrogen exposure (P = 0.05) was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data have shown that ERbeta is expressed in CaP metastases, validating the initiation of studies to evaluate selective ER modulators for treatment of advanced CaP.}

We made an empirical comparison of different versions of this model, using data from cancer registries in the Nordic countries for the period 1958-1997. We have applied 15 different methods to 20 sites for each sex in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Median absolute value of the relative difference between observed and predicted numbers of cases for these 160 combinations of site, sex and country was calculated. The medians varied between 10.4 per cent and 15.3 per cent in predictions 10 years ahead, and between 15.1 per cent and 32.0 per cent for 20 year predictions. We have four main conclusions: (i) projecting current trends worked better than assuming that future rates are equal to present rates; (ii) the method based on the multiplicative APC model often overestimated the number of cancer cases due to its exponential growth over time, but using a power function to level off this growth improved the predictions; (iii) projecting only half of the trend after the first 10 years also gave better long-term predictions; (iv) methods that emphasize trends in the last decade seem to perform better than those that include earlier time trends.}

The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia.}

The incidence of MM is particularly high in Western Australia because of the extensive blue asbestos mining operations that occurred in the north of the state until 1966. MM is unusual in that mutations in the tumour suppressor gene p53 are rarely observed, whilst over-expression of p53 protein is common. As the level of antibodies directed against p53 is thought to be of prognostic value in some cancers and as MM is known to be immunogenic, we studied a cohort of Western Australian patients to determine the prevalence of anti-p53 antibodies and their value as diagnostic markers or prognostic indicators. 6/88 (7\%) of patients had high titres ({\textgreater}2 SD above the mean of controls) of anti-p53 antibodies. There was no correlation between antibody titre and survival. Although 3/38 (8\%) of sera obtained from patients exposed to asbestos but prior to a diagnosis of MM contained antibodies, the same proportion of sera obtained from patients exposed to asbestos but who remained disease free also contained antibodies (2/40; 8\%). Sera collected sequentially demonstrated a profound temporal stability in the titre of anti-p53 antibodies in patients with MM throughout the course of their illness. These results show that anti-p53 antibodies are observed only at a low frequency in the sera of MM patients and where they do occur, their elicitation is an early event that may be unrelated to antigen load. The occurrence of anti-p53 antibodies does not serve as either a useful prognostic or diagnostic indicator in MM.}

Currently, both scientific literature and government documents exhibit important disagreements, confused terminology, and considerable, if not deliberate, vagueness about the meaning of the phrase 'cancer disparities' and the related term 'social disparities in health.' This article accordingly reviews critical issues relevant to cohering understanding of what is meant by 'cancer disparities;' offers a definition premised on the causal contention that social disparities in health, by definition, arise from social inequity; and considers its implications for developing a multidisciplinary research agenda on social inequalities in cancer. Tackling this issue will require rigorous and critical frameworks, questions, and methods derived from multiple disciplines, and will necessarily involve epidemiologic, clinical, and intervention research, both quantitative and qualitative. At issue is making conscious research choices: about which types of disparities we study, in relation to which aspect of cancer, so as to improve the likelihood our research will help inform a society-wide discourse about the extent, origins of, and remedies for social injustices in cancer, thereby aiding efforts to eliminate social inequalities in health.}

DESIGN: Three plausible "quality" scenarios for a biennial breast cancer screening programme for women aged 50-69 in Germany were analysed in terms of costs and effects using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model on breast cancer screening and the natural history of breast cancer. Firstly, sensitivity and specificity in the expected situation (or "baseline" scenario) were estimated from a model based analysis of empirical data from 35,000 screening examinations in two German pilot projects. In the second "high quality" scenario, these properties were based on the more favourable diagnostic results from breast cancer screening projects and the nationwide programme in The Netherlands. Thirdly, a worst case, "low quality" hypothetical scenario with a 25\% lower sensitivity than that experienced in The Netherlands was analysed. SETTING: The epidemiological and social situation in Germany in relation to mass screening for breast cancer. RESULTS: In the "baseline" scenario, an 11\% reduction in breast cancer mortality was expected in the total German female population, ie 2100 breast cancer deaths would be prevented per year. It was estimated that the "high quality" scenario, based on Dutch experience, would lead to the prevention of an additional 200 deaths per year and would also cut the number of false positive biopsy results by half. The cost per life year gained varied from Deutsche mark (DM) 15,000 on the "high quality" scenario to DM 21,000 in the "low quality" setting. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 20\% of the total costs of a screening programme can be spent on quality improvement in order to achieve a substantially higher reduction in mortality and reduce undesirable side effects while retaining the same cost effectiveness ratio as that estimated from the German data.}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, all new cases of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland were intended to be registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR). This register contains information on diagnosing unit, date of diagnosis, cause of diagnosis, tumor grade, tumor stage according to the TNM classification in force, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis and primary treatment given within the first 6 months after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 72,028 patients were registered, comprising {\textgreater}97\% of all pertinent incident cases of prostate cancer in the Swedish Cancer Register (SCR). During the study period there was a considerable decrease in median age at the time of diagnosis, a stage migration towards smaller tumors, a decrease in median serum PSA values at diagnosis, a decrease in the age-standardized incidence rate of men diagnosed with distant metastases or with a PSA level of {\textgreater} 100 ng/ml at diagnosis and an increase in the proportion of tumors with Gleason score or =75 years than in those aged {\textless}75 years. Also, the pattern of endocrine treatment varied in different parts of Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: All changes in the register seen over time are consistent with increased diagnostic activity, especially PSA testing, resulting in an increased number of cases with early disease, predominantly tumors in category T1c. The patterns of diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer vary considerably in different parts of Sweden. The NPCR continues to be an important source for research, epidemiological surveillance of the incidence, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.}

Exposure to asbestos is associated with reduced static lung volumes, gas transfer and lung compliance, and a restrictive ventilatory abnormality. METHODS: The effects of crocidolite exposure and smoking history on levels and rates of change of lung function were evaluated using a linear mixed model. Lung function was measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC. RESULTS: Cumulative doses of asbestos and the presence of radiographic asbestosis were associated with lower levels of FEV1 and FVC and a steeper decline during the period of observation. Subjects exposed to asbestos at a younger age had lower levels of FEV1 and FVC. Current smokers had lower levels and a steeper decline in lung function than never smokers. No significant interactions between crocidolite exposure and smoking on the levels or rates of change of lung function were found. CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious effects of crocidolite exposure on lung function persist in this population, despite asbestos exposure having ceased more than 30 years ago. No significant interactions were found in this population between asbestos and smoking at the first visit or longitudinally.}

All subjects completed the Rose questionnaire on chest pain and this revealed 556 subjects (43\%) who experienced some chest pain. A posterior-anterior chest radiograph was performed at the same clinic visit and was subsequently graded independently by two experienced readers for diffuse parenchymal disease and pleural disease. Logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, and cumulative asbestos exposure indicated that the presence of chest pain was significantly associated with the presence of both benign pleural disease and diffuse parenchymal disease. Further analysis after stratification of chest pain into nonanginal and anginal pain showed that there was a significant association between anginal pain and the presence of pleural and parenchymal asbestos-induced radiologic abnormalities and an association of nonanginal pain with parenchymal disease. We conclude that radiographic evidence of either parenchymal or pleural disease in subjects exposed to asbestos is significantly related to the presence of chest pain, particularly anginal pain.}

However, little is known with regard to general and disease specific quality of life in survivors of colorectal carcinoma, particularly from community-based samples of cases across stage and survival times from diagnosis. METHODS: Subjects with colorectal carcinoma were recruited from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Subjects completed two self-administered surveys: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scales for Colorectal Cancer (FACT-C) and the Health Utilities Index (HUI) Mark III. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three respondents (average age: 70.4 years, 71.4\% female) completed the survey. In the first 3 years after diagnosis, quality of life was lower and varied substantially among respondents. After 3 years, respondents in all TNM stages of disease except Stage IV reported a relatively uniform and high quality of life. Pain, functional well-being, and social well-being were affected most substantially across all stages and times from diagnosis. Low income status was associated with worse outcomes for pain, ambulation, and social and emotional well-being. Only emotional well-being scores improved significantly over time in both surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Those individuals who achieve a long term remission from colorectal carcinoma may experience a relatively high quality of life, although deficits remain for several areas, particularly in those of low socioeconomic status. Sampling design may have excluded the most severely ill patients.}

This analysis assesses current utilization patterns and projects the number of people with cancer and their use of oncologists' services through 2020. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries and Medicare physician claims were used to estimate oncologists' services from 1998 to 2003. We estimated the portion of patients with cancer who saw an oncologist, the mean number of visits, and the clinical setting where care was provided. Care was divided into initial, continuing, and last-year-of-life phases. Projections for future number of patients with cancer and visits were calculated by applying incidence and prevalence rates derived from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to census population projections through 2020. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who saw an oncologist was 47\% during the initial-care phase, 36\% during the continuing-care phase, and 70\% in the last year of life. The number of visits varied by age, sex, cancer site, and phase. The total number of cancer patients in the United States is projected to increase 55\%, from 11.8 million in 2005 to 18.2 million in 2020. Total oncology visits are projected to increase from 38 million in 2005 to 57 million in 2020. CONCLUSION: Utilization of oncologists' services will increase appreciably between 2005 and 2020; this will be driven predominantly by an increase in survivors of cancer and by the aging of the population. The United States may face an acute shortage of medical oncologists if efforts are not taken to meet this growing need.}

Failure to do so can lead to differential variability among cases and controls and the resulting confounding with a quadratic risk model. Both of these points are illustrated by an example.}

After controlling for potential confounding variables, including those which measured health care use and infant illness, the relative risk of SIDS for infants not being immunised at 6 weeks was 2.1 (95\% confidence interval=1.2, 3.5). Four per cent of cases died within four days of immunisation and 7.6\% of control infants had been immunised within four days of the nominated date. There was a reduced chance of SIDS in the four days immediately following immunisation (OR=0.5; 95\% CI=0.2 to 0.9).Conclusions-Immunisation does not increase the risk of SIDS and may even lower the risk.},

	abstract = {Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.},

Migrants constituted the large majority of workers. The list of workers is composed of 6,911 subjects (6,501 males). In it we identified 1,102 Italians (1,069 males) and completed the follow up for those previously lost, remained in Australia or returned to Italy. Up to 1997, 302 subjects (301 males) definitively resettled in Italy, almost always returning to their community of origin. The median length of work at Wittenoom for those resettled was 17.8 months. The resettled subjects are spread around Italy, and 112 subjects (37\%) already died. We compared the mortality rates of those returned to Italy to the rates of the male Italian population. Migrants were subjected to a strong selection before departure and were the target of a surveillance program during work at Wittenoom: however, for those resettled, instead of a healthy migrant effect, we observed an overmortality, mainly due to deaths from penumoconiosis (10 deaths vs 0.38 expected), from respiratory tumours (3 deaths from pleural mesothelioma and 4 from primary peritoneal tumours; an excess of lung cancers, SMR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.72-2.11, and an excess of undefined caused of deaths (SMR 6.29, 95\% CI 2.52-12.96). The study suggests that asbestos-related diseases and deaths have been observed among those resettled to Italy. In order to increase the precision of the follow up of the Wittenoom cohort, a search outside Australia should be carried out in some European countries for workers whose vital status was unconfirmed. Survivors in Italy are suffering from asbestosis, jeopardizing their life, and are at risk of cancer, but few have received information, actions aimed at reducing the accumulated risk, or compensation. Italy had a multi-million number of migrants for work, and an important percentage of migrants is returned to Italy: the effects of occupational exposures to adverse agents should be expected, but this topic has received up to now little attention.}

This is the first report from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality. METHODS: From 1993 through 2001, we randomly assigned 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers to receive either annual screening (38,343 subjects) or usual care as the control (38,350 subjects). Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years. The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation. Usual care sometimes included screening, as some organizations have recommended. The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained. RESULTS: In the screening group, rates of compliance were 85\% for PSA testing and 86\% for digital rectal examination. Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40\% in the first year to 52\% in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46\% for digital rectal examination. After 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 (2820 cancers) in the screening group and 95 (2322 cancers) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.22; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.29). The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 (50 deaths) in the screening group and 1.7 (44 deaths) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 1.70). The data at 10 years were 67\% complete and consistent with these overall findings. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 to 10 years of follow-up, the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups.

DESIGN: Population based, prospective cohort study with follow-up over three years. SETTING: New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Men with localised prostate cancer were eligible if aged less than 70 years, diagnosed between October 2000 and October 2002, and notified to the New South Wales central cancer registry. Controls were randomly selected from the New South Wales electoral roll and matched to cases by age and postcode. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: General health specific and disease specific function up to three years after diagnosis, according to the 12 item short form health survey and the University of California, Los Angeles prostate cancer index. RESULTS: 1642 (64\%) cases and 495 (63\%) eligible and contacted controls took part in the study. After adjustment for confounders, all active treatment groups had low odds of having better sexual function than controls, in particular men on androgen deprivation therapy (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.02, 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.07). Men treated surgically reported the worst urinary function (adjusted OR 0.17, 95\% CI 0.13 to 0.22). Bowel function was poorest in cases who had external beam radiotherapy (adjusted OR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.64). General physical and mental health scores were similar across treatment groups, but poorest in men who had androgen deprivation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The various treatments for localised prostate cancer each have persistent effects on quality of life. Sexual dysfunction three years after diagnosis was common in all treatment groups, whereas poor urinary function was less common. Bowel function was most compromised in those who had external beam radiotherapy. Men with prostate cancer and the clinicians who treat them should be aware of the effects of treatment on quality of life, and weigh them up against the patient's age and the risk of progression of prostate cancer if untreated to make informed decisions about treatment.},

Setting : Population-based biennial mammography screening was progressively introduced in NSW from 1988, with active recruitment and re-invitation for women aged 50-69 years, and reached full geographic coverage by 1996. Biennial mammography screening participation has varied widely over time and by municipality. METHODS: Breast cancer mortality by age, period and municipality was obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry. Biennial mammography screening rates for the same strata were obtained from the BreastScreen NSW database. Temporal changes in breast cancer mortality for NSW were summarised as annual average declines using Poisson regression. Breast cancer mortality for 1997-2001 was examined in relation to lagged biennial screening rates by municipality, adjusted for age, area socio-economic and geographic indicators, and breast cancer incidence, also using Poisson regression. RESULTS: For the 50-69 year age group, the mean annual breast cancer mortality decline was 0.8\% (not significant) for 1988-1994, and 4.4\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) for 1995-2001. Statistically significant negative associations between breast cancer mortality in 1997-2001 and lagged biennial screening rates were found with the highest significance at a four-year lag for women aged 50-69 years ( p = 0.0003) and also for women aged 50-79 years (p c = 0.0002). From the regression coefficient, a 70\% biennial screening rate is associated with 32\% lower breast cancer mortality (compared to zero screening). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of population-based mammography screening on breast cancer mortality in NSW inferred using this method is consistent with results of trials and other service studies. This suggests that population-based mammography screening programs can achieve significant reductions in breast cancer mortality with adequate participation.}

In these analyses, the usual non-specific age effects of the conventional APC models were replaced by hazard functions derived from two multistage models of carcinogenesis, the Armitage-Doll model and the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model. The extended APC models described the incidence data on pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas well. After adjustment for temporal trends, the data suggest that the age-specific incidence rates of both pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas are identical in men and women. Driven largely by birth cohort effects, age-adjusted rates of pleural mesothelioma among men rose from about 7.5 per million person-years in 1973 to about 20 per million person-years in the early 1990s and appear to be stable or declining thereafter. Age-adjusted rates of pleural mesothelioma among women have remained more or less constant at about 2.5 per million person-years over the period 1973-2005. Age-adjusted rates for peritoneal mesothelioma in both men (1.2 per million person-years) and women (0.8 per million person-years) exhibit no temporal trends over the period of the study. We estimate that approximately 94,000 cases of pleural and 15,000 cases of peritoneal mesothelioma will occur in the US over the period 2005-2050.},

	annote = {The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically developing countries. Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56\% of the cases and 64\% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23\% of the total cancer cases and 14\% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17\% of the total new cancer cases and 23\% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11\% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally. CA Cancer J Clin 2011.

Our objectives were (1) to describe an analysis of the spatial pattern of cancer incidence in Ontario and (2) to discuss the quality of data in the Ontario Cancer Registry with respect to the accuracy of local cancer rates. METHODS. Cancer incidence rates were calculated for 22 cancer sites in 49 counties of Ontario during 1976 to 1986. Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate completeness of case registration, and completeness of residence information was also assessed. Spatial autocorrelation was used in measuring the geographic pattern of incidence rates. Comparisons were also made between sexes and with earlier data from 1966 to 1975. RESULTS. The quality of the geographic data in the registry appeared good, and corrections for incomplete or inaccurate registration had little impact. About one third of the sex-site combinations showed some evidence of spatial patterning in the cancer rate. Particularly strong regional variation was noted for cancers of the stomach, lung, uterus, and prostate. CONCLUSIONS. The analysis revealed a number of cancers with significant spatial patterning of risk. Further work is needed to relate the cancer data to other information on potential life-style and environmental factors.}

METHODS: We identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years through registries in seven European countries for inclusion in our study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006. RESULTS: In the screening group, 82\% of men accepted at least one offer of screening. During a median follow-up of 9 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2\% in the screening group and 4.8\% in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group, as compared with the control group, was 0.80 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04). The absolute risk difference was 0.71 death per 1000 men. This means that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. The analysis of men who were actually screened during the first round (excluding subjects with noncompliance) provided a rate ratio for death from prostate cancer of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20\% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.)}

This paper describes an approach for using observational data to emulate randomized clinical trials that compare dynamic regimes of the form “initiate treatment within a certain time period of some time-varying covariate first crossing a particular threshold." We applied this method to data from the French Hospital database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4), an observational study of HIV-infected patients, in order to compare dynamic regimes of the form "initiate treatment within m months after the recorded CD4 cell count first drops below x cells/mm3" where x takes values from 200 to 500 in increments of 10 and m takes values 0 or 3. We describe the method in the context of this example and discuss some complications that arise in emulating a randomized experiment using observational data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy reduces mortality among men with localized prostate cancer; however, important questions regarding long-term benefit remain.
METHODS: Between 1989 and 1999, we randomly assigned 695 men with early prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy and followed them through the end of 2012. The primary end points in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) were death from any cause, death from prostate cancer, and the risk of metastases. Secondary end points included the initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy.
RESULTS: During 23.2 years of follow-up, 200 of 347 men in the surgery group and 247 of the 348 men in the watchful-waiting group died. Of the deaths, 63 in the surgery group and 99 in the watchful-waiting group were due to prostate cancer; the relative risk was 0.56 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.77; P=0.001), and the absolute difference was 11.0 percentage points (95\% CI, 4.5 to 17.5). The number needed to treat to prevent one death was 8. One man died after surgery in the radical-prostatectomy group. Androgen-deprivation therapy was used in fewer patients who underwent prostatectomy (a difference of 25.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, 17.7 to 32.3). The benefit of surgery with respect to death from prostate cancer was largest in men younger than 65 years of age (relative risk, 0.45) and in those with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (relative risk, 0.38). However, radical prostatectomy was associated with a reduced risk of metastases among older men (relative risk, 0.68; P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Extended follow-up confirmed a substantial reduction in mortality after radical prostatectomy; the number needed to treat to prevent one death continued to decrease when the treatment was modified according to age at diagnosis and tumor risk. A large proportion of long-term survivors in the watchful-waiting group have not required any palliative treatment. (Funded by the Swedish Cancer Society and others.).},

	annote = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Several observational studies have indicated that vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA), including paricalcitol, are associated with greater survival in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients; however, patients with higher serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), indicative of a more severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and higher death risk, are usually given higher VDRA dosages, which can lead to confounding by medical indication and attenuated survival advantage of high VDRA dosages. It was hypothesized that the ratio of the administered paricalcitol dosage to serum PTH level discloses better the underlying dosage-survival association. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: The 3-yr mortality predictability of the administered paricalcitol during the first 3 mo of the cohort divided by averaged serum intact PTH during the same period was examined in 34,307 MHD patients from all DaVita dialysis clinics across the United States using Cox regression. RESULTS: MHD patients were 60.8 +/- 15.4 yr of age and included 47\% women, 34\% black patients, and 47\% patients with diabetes. Initially, the ratio of paricalcitol (mircrog/wk) to PTH (pg/ml) was divided into four groups: 0 (reference), 1 to {\textless}30, 30 to {\textless}60, and {\textgreater}60 x 10(-3). Unadjusted, case mix-adjusted (demographics, comorbidity, and Kt/V), and malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome-adjusted models, the death rate ratio for the paricalcitol/PTH index groups, were 0.99, 0.95, and 0.92. Restricted cubic splines analyses were consistent with a linear relation. CONCLUSIONS: Higher weekly paricalcitol dosage per each unit of serum PTH seems to have an incremental association with greater survival in MHD patients. The observed dosage-response phenomenon needs to be confirmed in clinical trials.}

Compared with previously used methods, it performed better for providing point estimates when past trends continued into the future. However, the extremely wide credible intervals need careful interpretation.

In order to clarify the changing patterns of lung cancer in Europe we have plotted the overall lung cancer trends among men and women for 20 countries from 1950 up to 1998. Furthermore, using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5 year projections of lung cancer rate up to 2003. Finally, we make some comments on probable future trends by analysing recent trends in adults aged {\textless}55 years. Lung cancer mortality rates up to age 75 years portray a general trend of decreasing lung cancer rates among men and increasing lung cancer rates among women. Exceptions to this decrease among men include Hungary where not only are current mortality rates much higher than previously observed in any other country (at 76.7 out of 100,000 in 1998) but they are projected to increase further in the short term. Rates among adults aged {\textless}55 years have recently peaked, indicating that overall rates are likely to peak in the next decade. Among women, rapid increases have been observed in Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland and UK. Whereas Ireland and UK rates have started to decrease and are projected to continue falling, rates in the other three countries are projected to increase further. Trends in women aged {\textless}55 years indicate that rates in Danish women will peak in the next decade, whereas lung cancer rates among Dutch women are likely to continue increasing. Rates in Hungarian women are likely to increase and will surpass the current high rate observed in Denmark.}

	annote = {We consider the problem of locating multiple interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing traits measured in counts. In many applications the distribution of the count variable has a spike at zero. Zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression (ZIGPR) allows for an additional probability mass at zero and hence an improvement in the detection of significant loci. Classical model selection criteria often overestimate the QTL number. Therefore, modified versions of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC and EBIC) were successfully used for QTL mapping. We apply these criteria based on ZIGPR as well as simpler models. An extensive simulation study shows their good power detecting QTL while controlling the false discovery rate. We illustrate how the inability of the Poisson distribution to account for over-dispersion leads to an overestimation of the QTL number and hence strongly discourages its application for identifying factors influencing count data. The proposed method is used to analyze the mice gallstone data of Lyons et al. (2003). Our results suggest the existence of a novel QTL on chromosome 4 interacting with another QTL previously identified on chromosome 5. We provide the corresponding code in R.}

This interval has been called the detectable preclinical period (DPP). Misspecifying the duration of the DPP can bias the results of such studies. This article quantifies the impact of incorrectly estimating the duration of the DPP or using the correct average DPP but failing to consider its variability. The authors developed a computer simulation model of disease incidence and mortality with and without screening. The authors then selected cases and controls from the generated population and compared their screening histories. The results indicate that underestimation of the duration of the DPP generally leads to greater bias than does overestimation, but in both instances the extent of the bias is modified by the relative length of the DPP and the average interscreening interval. In practice, the authors recommend that to prevent a falsely low estimate of the effectiveness of a screening test in reducing mortality, a high percentile of the DPP distribution be used when analyzing the results of case-control studies of screening.}

Using regression models and adjusting for variation within individuals, we found no association between age and the number of CD4+ lymphocytes at seroconversion or with CD4+ lymphocyte decline after seroconversion. Men who developed opportunistic infections had fewer CD4+ lymphocytes at the time of diagnosis compared with men who developed AIDS-defining Kaposi's sarcoma. Older age was significantly associated with higher numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes in individuals diagnosed with AIDS-defining Kaposi's sarcoma but was not significant for individuals with opportunistic infections. Because older age shortens the latency period of Kaposi's sarcoma and does not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte loss, it results in higher CD4+ lymphocytes at the time of diagnosis. These findings suggest distinct biologic mechanisms for various AIDS manifestations, which is important for clinical decision making and health care planning.}

Assuming a Poisson distribution for the age and period specific numbers of incident cases approximate confidence and prediction intervals are calculated. The major advantage of this model over current models is that age-specific predictions can be made with greater accuracy. The model also preserves in the period of prediction the age pattern of incidence rates existing in the data. It may be fitted with any package which includes an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, for example GLIM.

Radiographs covering follow up periods of from two to 38 years were examined (median number of films per subject was nine). The degree of crocidolite exposure was estimated from employment records and a survey of airborne fibre concentrations performed in 1966. Agreement between the observers on the presence and degree of pleural disease in the final film for each subject was moderately close (Kendall's tau B = 0.62) and was least for subjects with thickening less than 5 mm in width. Diffuse pleural thickening extending for greater than 50\% of the lateral chest wall was the most common type recorded by both observers. Minor pleural thickening frequently progressed in extent along the lateral chest wall but progression beyond 5 mm in thickness was less common. Pleural plaques were not seen to progress beyond their initial thickness or extent. The rate of onset of thickening in this population increased continually from the time of first exposure and also increased slightly with age. There was evidence that the level of total cumulative exposure to crocidolite increased the rate of onset of pleural thickening in the period between five and 15 years after first exposure. Rate of progression of established thickening was greatest in subjects who first developed thickening early after first exposure. The relative rate of progression decreased slowly with time from first signs of thickening and there was no evidence of any progression more than 15 years after onset.}

The aims of this study were to determine if these are reversible with continued HIV suppression following protease inhibitor substitution. METHODS: Eighty-one HIV protease inhibitor recipients (78 male; mean antiretroviral therapy, 55 months) with predominant peripheral lipoatrophy, HIV RNA {\textless} 400 copies/ml plasma for at least the preceding 6 months, and no prior abacavir, non-nucleoside analogue or adefovir therapy were randomized 3 : 2 to continue nucleoside analogues and substitute protease inhibitor(s) with abacavir, nevirapine, adefovir and hydroxyurea (n = 49) or to continue all therapy (n = 32) with an option to switch at week 24. The primary endpoints were total body fat and HIV RNA at week 24. Other assessments were regimen safety, regional body composition, metabolic parameters, quality of life, and CD4 T- lymphocyte counts to week 48. RESULTS: There was a greater decline in total body fat in the switch group than in the continue group (-1.6 and -0.4 kg, respectively at week 24; P = 0.006). This comprised greater declines in limb and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and in intra-abdominal fat of patients with moderate or severe abdominal fat accumulation. Viral suppression was similar, despite 18 (37\%) switch group patients ceasing at least one study drug by week 24 because of adverse events. Total cholesterol and triglycerides declined more in the switch group (both P {\textless} 0.002). High density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in both groups at week 48 (P {\textless} 0.02). There was no change for any glycaemic parameter. CONCLUSIONS: In predominantly lipoatrophic patients, switching from HIV protease inhibitor therapy lead to improved lipids and less intra-abdominal fat, but also to less peripheral fat, and had minimal effect on insulin resistance. Virological control in these heavily pretreated patients was unaffected, despite frequent switch drug cessations},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland cover a population of 13 million inhabitants. Cancer registries in these countries supplied incidence and survival data for 465 000 cases of cancer. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as skin melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined was estimated for the end of 1992. RESULTS: A large heterogeneity was observed within central European countries. For all cancers combined, estimates ranged from 730 per 100 000 in Poland (men) to 3350 per 100 000 in Germany (women). Overall cancer prevalence was the highest in Germany and Switzerland, and the lowest in Poland and Slovenia. In Slovakia, prevalence was higher than average for men and lower than average for women. This was observed for almost all ages. As shown by incidence data, breast cancer was the most frequent malignancy among women in all countries. Among men, prostate cancer was the leading malignancy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and lung cancer was the major cancer in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. The Netherlands had a high prevalence of both prostate and lung cancer. Time-related magnitude of prevalence within each country and the variability of such proportions across the countries has been estimated and cancer prevalence is given by time since diagnosis (1 year, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, {\textgreater}10 years) for each site. The weight of 1-year prevalence (248 per 100 000 among men and 253 per 100 000 among women) was {\textless}15\% of total prevalence. Prevalent cases between 1 and 5 years since diagnosis represented between 22\% and 34\% of the total prevalence. Prevalent cases diagnosed from 5 to 10 years before (335 per 100 000 for men and 505 per 100 000 for women) represented between 17\% and 23\% of prevalent cancers. Finally, long-term cancer prevalence (diagnosed {\textgreater}10 years before), reflecting long-term survival, and number of people considered as cured from cancer were 490 per 100 000 for men and 1028 per 100 000 for women, with a range between 26\% (The Netherlands, men) and 50\% (Slovakia, women). CONCLUSION: It is clear from observing countries in Central Europe, that high cancer prevalence is associated with well-developed economies. This burden of cancer could be interpreted as a paradoxical effect of better treatments and thereby survival. It could also be taken as a sign for not being satisfied with the advances in treating patients diagnosed with cancer, and for supporting more primary prevention.}

METHODS: Two mathematical modeling teams of the US National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network independently projected disease mortality in the absence and presence of PSA screening. Both teams relied on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data for disease incidence, used common estimates of PSA screening rates, and assumed that screening, by shifting disease from distant to local-regional clinical stage, confers a corresponding improvement in disease-specific survival. RESULTS: The teams projected similar mortality increases in the absence of screening and decreases in the presence of screening after 1985. By 2000, the models projected that 45\% (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) to 70\% (University of Michigan) of the observed decline in prostate cancer mortality could be plausibly attributed to the stage shift induced by screening. CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening may account for much, but not all, of the observed drop in prostate cancer mortality. Other factors, such as changing treatment practices, may also have played a role in improving prostate cancer outcomes.}

Statistical modeling of data for the period 1960-84 revealed that both the age effects and the cohort effects were different for each site. While younger cohorts apparently had signs of reduced risk of both diseases, reduced risk was only apparent among the very youngest cohorts in the case of breast cancer, whereas there has been a gradual reduction in the risk of colon cancer among successive cohorts born since the beginning of the century. Clemmesen's hook was demonstrated in the age-incidence curve of breast cancer, which was clearly shown to have two different slopes: among premenopausal and among postmenopausal women. The declining risk of breast cancer in younger cohorts appeared contradictory to their apparently "high-risk" profile (in terms of present knowledge of etiologic factors) and suggested the possible existence of a factor that protects against breast cancer, at least at younger ages, but that remains, as yet, unidentified.}

Estimating the intensity of transition from health to illness by survival analysis (treating death as censoring) is biased downwards. Furthermore, the dates of transitions between states are not known exactly. We propose to estimate the intensity functions by maximizing a penalized likelihood. The method yields smooth estimates without parametric assumptions. This is illustrated using data from a large cohort study on cerebral ageing. The age-specific incidence of dementia is estimated using an illness-death approach and a survival approach.},

Effective colposcopy triage strategies are needed to identify the minority of women who have clinically significant disease while avoiding excessive follow-up evaluation for others. METHODS: The ASCUS/LSIL (i.e., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS) is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the following three management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3): 1) immediate colposcopy (considered to be the reference standard), 2) triage to colposcopy based on human papillomavirus (HPV) results from Hybrid Capture 2(TM) (HC 2) and thin-layer cytology results, or 3) triage based on cytology results alone. This article summarizes the cross-sectional enrollment results for 3488 women with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS. All statistical tests are two-sided. RESULTS: Among participants with ASCUS, the underlying prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN3 was 5.1\%. Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6\% to 98.8\%), with 56.1\% of women referred to colposcopy. Sensitivity of a single repeat cytology specimen with a triage threshold of HSIL or above was 44.1\% (95\% CI = 35.6\% to 52.9\%), with 6.9\% referred. Sensitivity of a lower cytology triage threshold of ASCUS or above was 85.3\% (95\% CI = 78.2\% to 90.8\%), with 58.6\% referred. CONCLUSIONS: HC 2 testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS. It has greater sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above and specificity comparable to a single additional cytologic test indicating ASCUS or above.}

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how follow-up time, number of physical symptoms, and presence of androgen deprivation affected quality of life among men randomized to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study group was composed of all 376 living men included in the Swedish part of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) between January 1, 1989, and February 29, 1996. Quality-of-life data were collected after a mean follow-up time of 4.1 yr. INTERVENTION: All patients were randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting. Forty-five men were androgen deprived. MEASUREMENTS: Data of specific symptoms, symptom-induced stress, sense of well-being, and self-assessed quality of life were obtained by means of a questionnaire. Psychological symptoms were assessed using seven-point visual digital scales. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In analyses stratified on the basis of the numbers of physical symptoms, anxiety and depressed mood were less common, and sense of well-being and self-assessed quality of life were better throughout in the radical prostatectomy group than in the watchful waiting group. As the number of physical symptoms increased, all psychological variables became worse and more prominent in the watchful waiting group. After a follow-up time of 6-8 yr, a significant decrease in quality of life (p=0.03) was seen in the watchful waiting group. Twenty-four percent of androgen-deprived patients assigned to watchful waiting reported high self-assessed quality of life compared with 60\% in the radical prostatectomy group. Eighty-eight percent of patients had clinically detected tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Androgen deprivation negatively affected self-assessed quality of life in men assigned to watchful waiting. The number of physical symptoms was associated with the level of quality of life. Quality of life was lower with longer follow-up time in both groups and was statistically significant in the watchful waiting group (p=0.03).},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Recent avoidable mortality trends in Australia suggest that health care has made a substantial contribution to reducing mortality. This study investigates if the benefits of health care have been distributed equally by comparing declines in avoidable with non-avoidable mortality over time by socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: We calculated avoidable and non-avoidable mortality rates in Australia by small areas for 1986, 1991, 1997 and 2002. We performed pooled cross-sectional trend analysis of indirectly standardized mortality rates by SES and year, modelling using Poisson regression with over-dispersion. Socioeconomic inequalities were quantified using the relative (RII) and slope (SII) index of inequality. RESULTS: The annual percentage decline in avoidable mortality at the higher end of the socioeconomic continuum (5.0\%; 95\% CI: 4.7-5.4\%) was larger than at the lower end (3.5\%; 3.2-3.8\%), with increasing relative inequality between 1986 (RII = 1.54; 1.46-1.63) and 2002 (RII = 2.00; 1.95-2.06), greater than that in non-avoidable mortality (P = 0.036). In absolute terms, avoidable deaths fell annually by 7.4 (6.9-7.8) and 8.4 (7.9-8.9) deaths per 100 000 at the higher and lower end of the spectrum, respectively, with absolute inequality decreasing between 1986 (SII = 97.8; 87.6-107.9) and 2002 (SII = 81.5; 74.6-88.5). CONCLUSIONS: Health care has contributed to decreasing the absolute SES mortality gap. However, advantaged people have obtained a disproportionate benefit of health care, contributing to widening relative health inequalities. A universal heath care system does not guarantee equality in health-care-related outcomes.}

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Regionally representative cross-sectional survey of 2184 children, 4 to 12 years of age, was conducted, and the socio-demographic characteristics of their parents from regional Victoria, Australia, 2003 to 2004, were obtained. RESULTS: The prevalences of overweight and obesity were 19.3 +/- 0.8\% (proportion +/- standard error) and 7.6 +/- 0.6\%, respectively, using international criteria, and the proportion of overweight/obese girls was significantly higher than that of boys (29.6 +/- 1.4\% vs. 23.9 +/- 1.3\%, chi2 = 9.01, p = 0.003). Children from households of lower SES had higher odds of being overweight/obese; lower SES was defined by lower paternal education (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.30) and lower area-level SES (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.25), adjusted for age, gender, height, and clustering by school. DISCUSSION: The prevalences of overweight and obesity are increasing in Australian children by about one percentage point per year. This equates to approximately 40,000 more overweight children each year, placing Australian children among those at highest risk around the world. In addition, girls are more likely to be overweight, and there is a general trend for children of lower SES to be at even greater risk of overweight and obesity.}

(1998, New England Journal of Medicine 339, 1957-1963) introduced an ad hoc method of adjusting for serial confounding assessed via an intensity score, which records cumulative differences over time between therapy actually received and therapy predicted by prior medical history. Outcomes are subsequently regressed on the intensity score and baseline covariates to determine whether intense treatment or exposure predicts a favorable response. We use a structural nested mean model to derive conditions sufficient for interpreting the Berlowitz results causally. We also consider a modified approach that scales the intensity at each time by the inverse expected treatment given prior medical history. This leads to a simple, two-step implementation of G-estimation if we assume a nonstandard but useful structural nested mean model in which subjects less likely to receive treatment are more likely to benefit from it. These modeling assumptions apply, for example, to health services research contexts in which differential access to care is a primary concern. They are also plausible in our analysis of the causal effect of potent antiretroviral therapy on change in CD4 cell count, because men in the sample who are less likely to initiate treatment when baseline CD4 counts are high are more likely to experience large positive changes. We further extend the methods to accomodate repeated outcomes and time-varying effects of time-varying exposures.}

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this difference in survival is caused by differences in the pattern of the complicating diseases. Information on patient follow-up after the AIDS diagnosis was obtained by retrospective case note review. The 6,546 patients were followed from the time of AIDS diagnosis as part of the multicentre AIDS in Europe study, which examined AIDS cases diagnosed at 52 centres in 17 European countries between 1979 and 1989. Occurrence of AIDS-defining events and demographic variables were recorded for all patients, and CD4 lymphocyte count at the time of AIDS diagnosis for approximately half the patients. After adjusting for imbalances in other variables, persons {\textgreater} or = 50 years of age had a significantly higher risk of contracting AIDS wasting syndrome, AIDS dementia complex and oesophageal candidiasis after the initial AIDS diagnosis, compared with age group 30-39 years [relative risk (RR) 95\% confidence interval (CI)], 3.23 (2.70-3.75 CI); 2.48 (2.16-2.80 CI); 1.55 (1.26-1.83 CI), respectively]. Shortened survival after the time of AIDS diagnosis was associated with older age. After adjusting for pattern of complicating diseases, the age effect remained unchanged. Older age predisposes to AIDS-related wasting syndrome, AIDS dementia complex and oesophageal candidiasis. Independent of these differences, older age is significantly associated with shortened survival, suggesting that factors such as severity of complicating diseases or the capability of handling serious infections, rather than disease pattern, are responsible for the shortened survival},

Simulation models have been used as a convenient and rapid method of exploring the outcome of different screening policies and of demonstrating the importance and interrelationships of the variables concerned. However, most such models are either too abstract or too simplistic to be of practical value in planning screening programmes. A model is described which reproduces demographic events in a female population (that of England and Wales) over a 30 year period, and onto this superimposes the natural history of cervical carcinoma, using data derived from published studies. A microsimulation approach--each individual in the population being retained as a unit--allows factors such as disease onset and screening uptake to be dependent upon personal characteristics and past events. Screening can be offered as part of a routine programme, or incidentally--for example during pregnancy or hospital attendance. The model allows quantitative evaluation of the complex patterns of screening that are actually observed and the relative importance of the different components of such screening programmes. Assumptions about natural history can thus be studied.}

Results shown here expand on those recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Berry et al., N Engl J Med 2005;353:1784-92) by presenting mortality impact in several different ways to facilitate comparisons between models. Comparisons of each group's results in the context of modeling assumptions made during the process gave insight into how specific model assumptions may have affected the results. The median estimate for the percent decline in breast cancer mortality due to mammography was 15\% (range of 8\%-23\%), and the median estimate for the percent decline in mortality due to adjuvant treatment was 19\% (range of 12\%-21\%). A detailed discussion of the differences in modeling approaches and how those differences may have influenced the mortality results concludes the chapter.}

Most who remain alive are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which has implications for their prognosis and choice of ART. The clinical status of a cohort of HIV-positive haemophilic men is reported together with their response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: A comprehensive care haemophilia centre. PATIENTS: A group of 111 haemophilic men who seroconverted to HIV in the period 1979 to 1985. RESULTS: The cohort has been followed since 1979. By 30 April 1999, 57 of the 111 men had developed AIDS and 65 had died: Kaplan-Meier rates of 57.0\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 46.9-67.0) and 65.1\% (95\% CI 52.7-77.4) by 19.5 years, respectively. AIDS rates have declined since 1997 but death rates have remained high, largely owing to deaths from non-HIV-related causes. Thirty-five patients remain alive and under follow-up at the clinic. The 28 men who had received ART had lower CD4 cell counts than the seven patients who had not received ART, but the two groups were otherwise similar. In total, 21 patients are known to have started HAART while under care at the centre. By 10-12 months after starting HAART, viral loads dropped by 2.06 log10 copies/ml and CD4 cell counts increased by 60 x 10(6) cells/l. In 10 out of 18 patients with viral loads initially {\textgreater} 400 copies/ml, a viral load below this level was attained; four had changed therapy at the time. CONCLUSIONS: While the decision to initiate HAART in haemophilic men should be made carefully because of the possible adverse events, our results suggest that a good response rate was achieved in this group of men},

These groups reflected the main target systems involved at the time of acute HIV-1 disease. Grouping of symptoms and signs based on groups of patients is potentially more informative than observations made on individual patients. It might facilitate diagnosis, suggest pathogenic mechanisms and reduce the number of variables for characterizing acute HIV-1 illness.}

Three interventions were tested. One used an individual counseling strategy, one used a community activities strategy, and a third combined the two strategies. METHODS: The effects of the interventions were tested by randomizing 40 communities either to the study interventions or to a control group. A cohort of 352 women from each community was randomly selected and used to evaluate the interventions' effectiveness. Of these, 6592 women were eligible for screening mammography at baseline and follow-up and were successfully interviewed prior to and after study intervention activities. RESULTS: Although the interventions did not significantly increase women's overall use of mammography, the community activities intervention increased use at follow-up by regular users over baseline by 2.9\% (p = 0.01). Intervention appears to have increased the use of mammography among certain groups of women who were not regular users at baseline, including those in communities without female physicians (10\% to 16\%; p {\textless} 0.05), and among women with no health insurance (10\% to 23\%; p }

Significant differences in duration of labor were also observed. The findings were not altered by statistical adjustments for various prenatal differences between the groups.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The UREPIK survey collected information on this relationship from men and their partners in the Netherlands, Korea, France and the UK. Culturally and linguistically validated versions of three standard questionnaires, the SF-12, the BII and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were used to assess the distribution of symptoms and the impact on health status. Stratified random samples of men aged 40-79 years in each community were recruited. Response rates were 72\% in Boxmeer, 28\% in Auxerre, 60\% in Birmingham and 68\% in Seoul. Regression analyses were undertaken on total SF-12, BII and IPSS. RESULTS: In all, 4800 index men and 3674 women responded; the BII increased with increasing IPSS. The correlation coefficients were; Boxmeer 0.69, Auxerre 0.56, Birmingham 0.60 and Seoul 0.68. For women, the correlations were slightly lower except in Birmingham, at 0.65 (Boxmeer), 0.44 (Auxerre), 0.71 (Birmingham), 0.57 (Korea). BII scores were higher in women than in men with the same level of IPSS. Adjusting for IPSS there was no association between age and BII. There was an association between IPSS quality-of-life (QoL) score and BII; for men the correlation was 0.62 and for women 0.60. Men and women with the same score on the IPSS QoL reported the same bother. Among those with an IPSS of 20-35 women expressed significantly more bother (P {\textless} 0.001). The SF-12 scores decreased as the IPSS and the BII increased in both men and women. Furthermore, the SF-12 mental score decreased with increasing symptoms in the partner. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the severity of LUTS and BII was similar in all centres. There is a clear association between the BII and the IPSS QoL question in men and women. The BII discriminates between people who are unhappy about their urinary condition compared with those who are pleased. Although designed for use in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, the index also appears to be a useful among women. The severity of symptoms of LUTS has an adverse effect on the health status of the individual and his/her partner.}

DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used to compare pre- and postintervention annual screening rates. Rates were determined by medical record audits. SETTING: Two urban public hospital primary care clinics served as the study sites. PATIENTS: All women aged 65 years or more were eligible to participate. INTERVENTIONS: Women were offered screening by a NP during a routine visit in the intervention site; a physician reminder system was used in the control site. MAIN RESULTS: Baseline annual screening rates were comparable in the two study sites. At the end of the study period, rates were significantly higher in the NP site, compared with the control. In the NP clinic, the annual rate of Pap tests increased to 56.9\% from the baseline of 17.8\%, and mammographies increased to 40\% from 18.3\%. In comparison, rates remained low in the control site, increasing only to 18.2\% of women receiving Pap tests from a baseline of 11.8\%, and remaining at 18\% for mammography. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a NP to deliver same-day screening is an effective strategy to target poor, elderly black women for breast and cervical cancer screening. However, even with the substantial increases in rates obtained with the NP intervention, screening in this vulnerable population remains below nationally targeted levels.}

Similarly, the effect of age often is presented graphically as age-specific rates for a given period of diagnosis. These approaches may be necessary if there is an absence of long-term data, as they provide a natural way for annually updating information when monitoring trends, or they may be a convenient way of summarizing a large amount of data (7, 10, 11, 39, 45). However, these summaries only can adjust for the effect of age in a given period; they implicitly ignore the cohort effect. The effect of cohort is an important factor in understanding time trends for many diseases. Thus, it is not advisable to use data analytic strategies that routinely ignore it. Another alternative to modeling is to give a graphical presentation of the age-specific rates themselves. As I noted in the introduction, some of the first analyses to identify the effect of cohort on diseases, such as tuberculosis and lung cancer, relied entirely on a graphical analysis. Although graphs certainly are an important part of the interpretation of time trends, it would be a mistake to limit your analysis to impressions of points on a graph. For example, such a perusal would not give an objective indication of the statistical significance of a particular pattern. Regression analysis forces us to recognize a fundamental problem with interpreting time trends in disease rates--a problem that you should remember, even when trying to understand a graphical display of time trends in age-specific rates.}

Whether HPV DNA testing alone is useful in primary screening remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of HPV DNA testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or cancer (the criterion standard). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 1997 and October 2000, 4075 women who attended Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington State were screened simultaneously using thin-layer Pap and HPV DNA testing by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method and by a liquid-based RNA-DNA hybridization capture with signal amplification assay (signal amplification). Women who were positive for high-risk HPV types, or had Pap results of ASCUS or higher, were considered to have positive screening test results and were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Additionally, a random sample of women with negative screening test results was referred for colposcopy. Based on individual and combined thin-layer Pap, HPV PCR, and HPV signal amplification test results from the screening and the colposcopy visits, 7 colposcopy triage strategies were defined and evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sensitivity and specificity for detecting cervical lesions graded CIN 3 or higher for each of the 7 triage strategies. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of CIN 3 or higher was 3.2\%. The sensitivity (95\% confidence interval) of thin-layer Pap (with a result of {\textgreater} or = ASCUS) for identifying women with CIN 3 or higher was only 61.3\% (48.5\%-70.9\%) compared with 88.2\% (78.9\%-93.8\%) for HPV testing by PCR and 90.8\% (83.1\%-95.8\%) by signal amplification. Differences in specificities were also observed: 82.4\% (81.8\%-83.1\%) for thin-layer Pap (with a result of {\textgreater} or = ASCUS), 78.8\% (77.9\%-79.7\%) for PCR, and 72.6\% (69.4\%-75.0\%) for signal amplification. Compared with referral for colposcopy of all women with ASCUS or higher, signal amplification testing of women with ASCUS and referral of those with a positive result was about as sensitive (61.3\% vs 60.3\%, respectively) and significantly more specific (82.4\% vs 88.9\%, respectively). The strategy requiring repeat positive PCR tests on 2 visits had a sensitivity of 84.2\% (75.3\%-91.0\%) and a specificity of 86.2\% (85.1\%-87.3\%). All tests were more specific and less sensitive in older ({\textgreater} or = 30 years) vs younger women. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for HPV has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than thin-layer Pap screening. In some settings, particularly where screening intervals are long or haphazard, screening for HPV DNA may be a reasonable alternative to cytology-based screening of reproductive-age women.}

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between concentrations of prostate specific antigen at age 60 and subsequent diagnosis of clinically relevant prostate cancer in an unscreened population to evaluate whether screening for prostate cancer and chemoprevention could be stratified by risk.
DESIGN: Case-control study with 1:3 matching nested within a highly representative population based cohort study.
SETTING: General population of Sweden taking part in the Malmo Preventive Project. Cancer registry at the National Board of Health and Welfare.
PARTICIPANTS: 1167 men aged 60 who provided blood samples in 1981 and were followed up to age 85.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Metastasis or death from prostate cancer.
RESULTS: The rate of screening during the course of the study was low. There were 43 cases of metastasis and 35 deaths from prostate cancer. Concentration of prostate specific antigen at age 60 was associated with prostate cancer metastasis (area under the curve 0.86, 95\% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.92; P{\textless}0.001) and death from prostate cancer (0.90, 0.84 to 0.96; P{\textless}0.001). The greater the number for the area under the curve (values from 0 to 1) the better the test. Although only a minority of the men with concentrations in the top quarter ({\textgreater}2 ng/ml) develop fatal prostate cancer, 90\% (78\% to 100\%) of deaths from prostate cancer occurred in these men. Conversely, men aged 60 with concentrations at the median or lower (≤1 ng/ml) were unlikely to have clinically relevant prostate cancer (0.5\% risk of metastasis by age 85 and 0.2\% risk of death from prostate cancer).
CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of prostate specific antigen at age 60 predicts lifetime risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Though men aged 60 with concentrations below the median (≤1 ng/ml) might harbour prostate cancer, it is unlikely to become life threatening. Such men could be exempted from further screening, which should instead focus on men with higher concentrations.},

Such data are needed to quantify the risks associated with smoking and to understand racial and sex disparities and temporal trends that are due to factors other than active smoking. METHODS We measured age-, sex-, and race-specific rates (per 100,000 person-years at risk) of death from lung cancer among more than 940,000 adults who reported no history of smoking at enrollment in either of two large American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study cohorts during 1959-1972 (CPS-I) and 1982-2000 (CPS-II). We compared lung cancer death rates between men and women and between African Americans and whites and analyzed temporal trends in lung cancer death rates among never smokers across the two studies by using directly age-standardized rates as well as Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS The age-standardized lung cancer death rates among never-smoking men and women in CPS-II were 17.1 and 14.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Men who had never smoked had higher age-standardized lung cancer death rates than women in both studies (CPS-I: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28 to 1.79; CPS-II: HR = 1.21, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 1.36). The rate was higher among African American women than white women in CPS-II (HR = 1.43, CI = 1.11 to 1.85). A small temporal increase (CPS-II versus CPS-I) in lung cancer mortality was seen for white women (HR = 1.25, CI = 1.12 to 1.41) and African American women (HR = 1.22, CI = 0.64 to 2.33), but not for white men (HR = 0.89, CI = 0.74 to 1.08). Among white and African American women combined, the temporal increase was statistically significant only among those aged 70-84 years (P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS Contrary to clinical perception, the lung cancer death rate is not higher in female than in male never smokers and shows little evidence of having increased over time in the absence of smoking. Factors that affect the interpretation of lung cancer trends are discussed. Our novel finding that lung cancer mortality is higher among African American than white women never smokers should be confirmed in other studies.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment could be greatly advanced with new, effective biomarkers. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has multiple weaknesses as a biomarker, such as not distinguishing well between cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia or between indolent and aggressive cancers, thus leading to overtreatment, especially unnecessary biopsies. PSA also often fails to indicate accurately which patients are responding to a given treatment. Yet PSA is the only prostate cancer biomarker routinely used by urologists. Here, we provide updated information on the most relevant of the other biomarkers currently in use or in development for prostate cancer. Recent research shows improvement over using PSA alone by comparing total PSA (tPSA) or free PSA (fPSA) with new, related markers, such as prostate cancer antigen (PCA) 3, the individual molecular forms of PSA (proPSA, benign PSA, and intact PSA), and kallikreins other than PSA. Promising results have also been seen with the use of the fusion gene TMPRSS2:ERG and with various forms of the urokinase plasminogen activation receptor. Initially, there were high hopes for early PCA, but those data were not reproducible and thus research on early PCA has been abandoned. Much work remains to be done before any of these biomarkers are fully validated and accepted. Currently, the only markers discussed in this paper with Food and Drug Administration-approved tests are PCA 3 and an isoform of proPSA, [-2]proPSA. Assays are in development for most of the other biomarkers described in this paper. While the biomarker validation process can be long and filled with obstacles, the rewards will be great-in terms of both patient care and costs to the health care system.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers that can be used in combination with established screening tests to reduce false positive rates are in considerable demand. In this article, we present methods for evaluating the diagnostic performance of combination tests that require positivity on a biomarker test in addition to a standard screening test. These methods rely on relative true and false positive rates to measure the loss in sensitivity and gain in specificity associated with the combination relative to the standard test. Inference about the relative rates follows from noting their interpretation as conditional probabilities. These methods are extended to evaluate combinations with continuous biomarker tests by introducing a new statistical entity, the relative receiver operating characteristic (rROC) curve. The rROC curve plots the relative true positive rate versus the relative false positive rate as the biomarker threshold for positivity varies. Inference can be made by applying existing ROC methodology. We illustrate the methods with two examples: a breast cancer biomarker study proposed by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) and a prostate cancer case-control study examining the ability of free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to improve the specificity of the standard PSA test.},

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as an alternative to repeat cytology in women who had equivocal results on a previous Pap smear. METHODS: Data were extracted from articles published between 1992 and 2002 that contained results of virologic and cytologic testing followed by colposcopically directed biopsy in women with an index smear showing atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Fifteen studies were identified in which HPV triage and the histologic outcome (presence or absence of a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade II or worse [CIN2+]) was documented. Nine, seven, and two studies also documented the accuracy of repeat cytology when the cutoff for abnormal cytology was set at a threshold of ASCUS or worse, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse, or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse, respectively. Random-effects models were used for pooling of accuracy parameters in case of interstudy heterogeneity. Differences in accuracy were assessed by pooling the ratio of the sensitivity (or specificity) of HPV testing to that of repeat cytology. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity were 84.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 77.6\% to 91.1\%) and 72.9\% (95\% CI = 62.5\% to 83.3\%), respectively, for HPV testing overall and 94.8\% (95\% CI = 92.7\% to 96.9\%) and 67.3\% (95\% CI = 58.2\% to 76.4\%), respectively, for HPV testing in the eight studies that used the Hybrid Capture II assay. Sensitivity and specificity of repeat cytology at a threshold for abnormal cytology of ASCUS or worse was 81.8\% (95\% CI = 73.5\% to 84.3\%) and 57.6\% (95\% CI = 49.5\% to 65.7\%), respectively. Repeat cytology that used higher cytologic thresholds yielded substantially lower sensitivity but higher specificity than triage with the Hybrid Capture II assay. The ratio of the sensitivity of the Hybrid Capture II assay to that of repeat cytology at a threshold of ASCUS or worse pooled from the four studies that used both triage tests was 1.16 (95\% CI = 1.04 to 1.29). The specificity ratio was not statistically different from unity. CONCLUSION: The published literature indicates that the Hybrid Capture II assay has improved accuracy (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than the repeat Pap smear using the threshold of ASCUS for an outcome of CIN2+ among women with equivocal cytologic results. The sensitivity of triage at higher cytologic cutoffs is poor.}

METHODS: The mortality experience of a cohort of over 5000 men and women followed up for over 30 years since first exposure to asbestos has been extracted. RESULTS: There was a large excess of deaths due to cancer (537 observed, 222 expected). Most of these were due to cancer of the lung (232 observed, 77 expected) and pleural (52) and peritoneal (48) mesothelioma. The exposure-response trend for all these three causes was highly significant. There was also an excess of cancer of the colon (27 observed, 15 expected) which was significantly related to exposure. There were significant excesses of cancer of the ovary, of the liver, and of the oesophagus but with no consistent relation to exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The excess risk of cancer after exposure to asbestos was mainly due to cancer of the lung and mesothelioma. An exposure related excess of cancer of the colon was also detected but the possibility that some of these deaths may have been peritoneal mesotheliomas could not be excluded. There was no consistent evidence of exposure related excesses at any other site.}

The sensitivity of LCNB (0.97) and resource use and costs of LCNB and NLBB were derived from a multicentre consecutive cohort study among 973 women who consented in getting LCNB and NLBB, if LCNB was negative. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Replacing NLBB with LCNB would result in approximately six more breast cancer deaths per year (in a target population of 2.1 million women), or in 1000 extra life-years lost from breast cancer (effect over 100 years). The total costs of management of breast cancer (3\% discounted) are estimated at pound 4676 million with NLBB; introducing LCNB would save pound 13 million. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of continued NLBB vs LCNB would be pound 12 482 per additional life-year gained (3\% discounted); incremental costs range from pound -21 687 (low threshold for breast biopsy) to pound 74 378 (high sensitivity of LCNB).}

METHODS: Medicare data were linked with tumor registry data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. A 5 percent random sample (n = 39985) of Medicare beneficiaries from the SEER areas without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer as of January 1, 1988 was followed through 1994. Trends in first-time PSA use were distinguished from those of second or later for men without diagnosed prostate cancer. RESULTS: Trends in the rate of first-time PSA procedures track closely with trends in prostate cancer incidence rates, increasing until 1992 and decreasing thereafter. Similar patterns were observed by race and age group. Geographic variability in the dissemination of PSA screening was observed, yet the association between testing and incidence remained. Men in the cohort had a 4.7 percent chance of being diagnosed within three months of an initial PSA test, with the percentage falling for subsequent tests. CONCLUSIONS: It is informative to distinguish first from later tests when assessing the effect of the diffusion of a test in a population. Taking this approach was useful in illuminating the role of PSA testing in a reversal of a long-term increase in prostate cancer incidence rates.}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From three centres in the ERSPC (Finland, The Netherlands and Sweden) 50 194 screened men aged 50.2-78.4 years were prospectively followed. A cohort of 12 959 first-time screening-positive men (i.e. with biopsy indication) was compared with another cohort of 37 235 first-time screening-negative men. Overall mortality rates (i.e. other cause than prostate cancer mortality) were calculated and the 120-day and 1-year cumulative mortality were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with a log-rank test for statistical significance. Incidence rate ratios (RR) and statistical significance were evaluated using Poisson regression analyses, adjusting for age, total PSA level, screening centre and whether a biopsy indication was present, or whether a biopsy was actually performed or not. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in cumulative 120-day other cause mortality between the two groups of men: 0.24\% (95\% CI, 0.17-0.34) for screening-positive men vs 0.24\% (95\% CI, 0.20-0.30) for screening-negative men (P= 0.96). This implied no excess mortality for screening-positive men. Screening-positive men who were not biopsied (n= 1238) had a more than fourfold risk of other cause mortality during the first 120 days compared to screening-negative men: RR, 4.52 (95\% CI, 2.63-7.74) (P {\textless} 0.001), adjusted for age, whereas men who were actually biopsied (n= 11 721) had half the risk: RR, 0.41 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.73) (P= 0.002), adjusted for age. Only 14/31 (45\%) of the screening-positive men who died within 120 days were biopsied and none died as an obvious complication to the biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate biopsy is not associated with excess mortality and fatal complications appear to be very rare.}

Based on a log-linear regression model with Poisson errors, the annual rates of change for 10 cancers and all other cancers combined, by age, sex and urban/rural residence were estimated from the data of the surveillance system of the Center for Health Information and Statistics, covering about 10\% of the national population. These rates of change were applied to the survey data of 1990-1992 to estimate national mortality in the year 2000, and to make projections for 2005. Mortality rates for all cancers combined, adjusted for age, are predicted to change little between 1991 and 2005 (-0.8\% in men and +2.5\% in women), but population growth and ageing will result in an increasing number of deaths, from 1.2 to 1.8 million. The largest predicted increases are for the numbers of female breast (+155.4\%) and lung cancers (+112.1\% in men, +153.5\% in women). For these two sites, mortality rates will almost double. Cancer will make an increasing contribution to the burden of diseases in China in the 21st century. The marked increases in risk of cancers of the lung, female breast and large bowel indicate priorities for prevention and control. The increasing trends in young age groups for cancers of the cervix, lung and female breast suggest that their predicted increases may be underestimated, and that more attention should be paid to strategies for their prevention and control.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: Proviral HIV-1 DNA was quantified in serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 19 patients enrolled in the French prospective PRIMO Cohort for whom plasma HIV RNA was suppressed to undetectable levels after one year of triple therapy; that is, plasma HIV-1 RNA was maintained below 200 copies/ml. Results were compared with those observed in 19 patients with chronic HIV-1 infection presenting the same degree of virus suppression after 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: At study entry, PRIMO subjects presented heterogeneous levels of proviral HIV-1 DNA: 2-3.92 log10 copies/10(6) PBMC and plasma HIV RNA: 2.3-6.5 log10 copies/ml. One year of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) resulted in a median diminution of proviral DNA of -0.78 log10/10(6) PBMC in PRIMO subjects. The median decline in chronic-phase patients was -0.32 for those who were pre-treated and -0.52 for those previously naive of treatment. CONCLUSION: The decline in cell-associated HIV DNA observed throughout one year treatment indicated that HAART reduces the proviral HIV-DNA load more effectively when initiated during the primary rather than the chronic phase of HIV infection. These findings therefore tend to lend support to the early initiation of treatment. Nevertheless, heterogeneous baseline values observed for CD4 cell count, plasma HIV RNA and proviral HIV DNA in PRIMO subjects, raise the question of whether treatment should be delayed in some to spare early adverse effects of HAART.}

OBJECTIVE: To apply age-specific predictions of PSA level (developed in men without cancer) to one cohort of men with clinically identified PCa and one cohort of men with PSA-detected PCa. We hypothesise that among men with clinically identified cancer, the annual increase in PSA level would be steeper than in men with PSA-detected cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 (SPCG-4) cohort consisted of 321 men assigned to the watchful waiting arm of the SPCG-4 trial. The UK cohort consisted of 320 men with PSA-detected PCa in the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study who opted for monitoring. Multilevel models describing changes in PSA level were fitted to the two cohorts, and average PSA level at age 50, change in PSA level with age, and predicted PSA values were derived. MEASUREMENTS: PSA level. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the SPCG-4 cohort, mean PSA at age 50 was similar to the cancer-free cohort but with a steeper yearly increase in PSA level (16.4\% vs 4.0\%). In the UK cohort, mean PSA level was higher than that in the cancer-free cohort (due to a PSA biopsy threshold of 3.0 ng/ml) but with a similar yearly increase in PSA level (4.1\%). Predictions were less accurate for the SPCG-4 cohort (median difference between observed and predicted PSA level: -2.0 ng/ml; interquartile range [IQR]: -7.6-0.7 ng/ml) than for the UK cohort (median difference between observed and predicted PSA level: -0.8 ng/ml; IQR: -2.1-0.1 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: In PSA-detected men, yearly change in PSA was similar to that in cancer-free men, whereas in men with symptomatic PCa, the yearly change in PSA level was considerably higher. Our method needs further evaluation but has promise for refining active monitoring protocols.},

Further recordings were made whenever an older sibling developed an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), again four to six days later, and again two weeks later, aiming to achieve recordings before, during, and after an URTI in the infant. The temperature of the room and wrapping of the infant were determined according to their usual practice by the parents. Parents added appropriate wrapping to achieve thermal neutrality based on our calculated values and the measured oxygen consumption. In five of the six infants who developed an URTI in the first three months after birth there was no change or a decrease in metabolic rate at the time of the infection; for infants older than 3 months the metabolic rate increased in three of the five episodes recorded. Peripheral skin temperature decreased at the time of URTI at all ages, though in the older infants it usually increased in parallel with rectal temperature during the latter part of the night, when pyrexia was most common. Infants thus respond to URTI by heat conservation. In the younger infants the lower metabolic rate and the further decrease in this rate with URTI means that fever is rare, and their temperature may decrease on infection. In the older infants the increase in metabolic rate (from an already higher baseline) may result in fever. These differences may contribute to the increased vulnerability of the older infants to heat stress, particularly at the time of acute viral infections.}

The objective of this study was to compare 3 approaches for estimating the incidence costs of colorectal cancer (CRC) care using similar patient populations, but different data sources and methods. METHODS: We used 2 data sources, linked SEER-Medicare and Medicare claims alone, to identify newly diagnosed CRC patients aged 65 and older and estimated their healthcare costs during the observation period, 1998 to 2002. Controls were matched by sex, age-group, and geographic location. We compared mean net costs, measured as the difference in total cost between cases and controls, for: (1) a SEER-Medicare cohort, (2) a Medicare claims alone cohort, and (3) a modeled phase of care approach using linked SEER-Medicare data. The SEER-Medicare cohort approach was considered the reference. RESULTS: We found considerable variability across approaches for estimating net costs of care in CRC patients. In the first year after diagnosis, mean net costs were \$32,648 (95\% CI: \$31,826 and \$33,470) in the SEER-Medicare cohort. The other approaches understated mean net costs in year 1 by about 16\%. Mean net 5-year costs of care were \$37,227 (95\% CI: \$35,711 and \$38,744) in the SEER-Medicare cohort, and \$30,310 (95\% CI: \$25,894 and \$34,726) in the claims only approach, with the largest difference in the 65 to 69 age group. Mean net 5-year costs of care were more similar to the reference in the modeled phase of care approach (\$37,701 [range: \$36,972 and \$38,446]). Differences from the SEER-Medicare cohort estimates reflect misclassification of prevalent cancer patients as newly diagnosed patients in the Medicare claims only approach, and differences in years of data and assumptions about comparison groups in the modeled phase of care approach. CONCLUSIONS: CRC incidence cost estimates vary substantially depending on the strategy and data source for identifying newly diagnosed cancer patients and methods for estimating longitudinal costs. Our findings may inform estimation of costs for other cancers as well as other diseases.},

METHODS: Drug susceptibility was assessed using Antivirogram and genotypic analysis was based on population and clonal sequencing for 48 patients who had interrupted treatment ({\textgreater} or = 2 months). RESULTS: Treatment interruption resulted in viral load increases (mean 0.7 log 10 copies/ ml; P = 0.0001) and CD4 cell count decreases (mean 89 x 10(6) cells/l; P = 0.0001). A complete shift to wild-type virus at the phenotypic, genotypic and clonal level was observed in 28/45 patients. These patients differed from those that did not show a shift to wild type in baseline CD4 cell counts (192 versus 59 x 10(6) cells/l; P= 0.007) and in the relationship between baseline viral load and CD4 cell count (no correlation versus a significant negative correlation; P= 0.008). Response to re-initiation of treatment fell with increasing viral load [relative hazard (RH) 0.33; P= 0.001] and with increasing total number of drugs with reduced susceptibility (RH 0.51; P = 0.0003); it improved with the number of new drugs received (RH 2.12; P = 0.0002) and a shift to wild type (RH 5.22, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in surrogate markers suggest that treatment provided benefit in spite of virological failure and resistant virus. Although patients with a shift to wildtype virus responded better in the short term to treatment re-initiation, the long-term effects are not known and the risk of immune deterioration needs to be carefully considered},

METHODS: Cause-specific survival data from 1973 to 2000 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Survival cure models were fit and were used to estimate the gain in life expectancy (GLE) attributed to an increase in the fraction of cured patients and to prolonged survival among noncured patients. RESULTS: Treatment improvement for ovarian cancer resulted in a total GLE of 2 years, and 80\% of that GLE was because of an extension of survival time in uncured patients (from 0.9 years to 2.1 years) rather than an increased cure fraction (from 12\% to 14\%). In contrast, the cure rate rose from 29\% to 47\% for colorectal cancer, representing 82\% of a 2.8-year GLE, and from 23\% to 81\% for testicular cancer, representing 100\% of a 24-year GLE. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that treatment benefits for testicular and colorectal cancer in men with late-stage disease primarily are the result of increases in cure fraction, whereas survival gains for ovarian cancer occur despite persisting disease. Cure models, in combination with population-level data, provide insight into how treatment advances are changing survival and ultimately impacting mortality. Survival patterns reflect the underlying biology of response to cancer treatment and suggest promising directions for future research.}

In particular, the authors address the questions of when to sample and how many observations to sample at each sampling time, assuming realistically that the sample variance of quality of life is not constant over time. The method is particularly useful for the design problems researchers face when time or research budget constraints limit the number of individuals that can be surveyed to estimate quality of life. The article focuses on cross-sectional sampling. The method proposed requires some knowledge of survival in the population of interest, the approximate variances in utilities at various points along the curve, and the general shape of the quality-adjusted survival curve. Such data are frequently available from disease registries, the literature, or previous studies.}

DESIGN: Prospective study of individuals (Italian Seroconversion Study cohort) with well-estimated dates of HIV-1 seroconversion. METHODS: This analysis included 277 participants who began HAART (defined as three antiretroviral drugs used in combination). Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between duration of infection (as categorical variable [7.5 years from seroconversion] or continuous variable) and an immunologic (rise in CD4 count {\textgreater}100 cells/mm3) and a virologic (decline in plasma HIV-RNA to unquantifiable levels) outcome. All analyses were stratified by center of recruitment and adjustment, when used, was for gender, age at inception of HAART, injection drug use, previous antiretroviral therapy, lag-time between positive and negative HIV test result, year of starting HAART, clinical stage, CD4 count, and HIV-RNA at time of HAART. RESULTS: HAART was initiated a median of 6.4 years after seroconversion. There was a median follow-up of 1.6 years after starting HAART to the calendar cut-off (November 1999). One-hundred-eighty-one (65.3\%) patients experienced a decline in viral load to below quantifiable levels and 184 (66.4\%) experienced a rise in CD4 {\textgreater}100 cells/mm3. In the Cox models, by 1-year increase in duration of infection, we estimated a lower crude hazard of achieving a CD4 count increase {\textgreater}100 cells (relative hazard [RH], 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.01; p =.09), and a lower hazard of reaching an unquantifiable level of plasma HIV-RNA (RH, 0.97; 95\%CI, 0.93-1.02; p =.20). After adjustment, these values became 0.99 (95\%CI, 0.93-1.04; p =.62) and 0.98 (95\%CI, 0.93-1.04; p =.48), respectively. When duration of HIV infection was considered as a categorical variable, the results were consistent with those already described.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Currently, several prostate cancer rescreening intervals are in use in different countries worldwide, varying from 1 to 4 years. Recently, it has been proposed to determine the rescreening interval relative to the initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and possibly to extend the rescreening interval up to 5 years.


METHODS

We evaluated the screening results of two subsequent screening visits (4-year interval) of 1703 men aged 55 to 65 years with an initial PSA level of 1.0 ng/mL or less within a randomized screening trial. We assessed the PSA values, numbers of men biopsied (biopsy indication: PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or greater), and numbers of cancers detected at the second and third screening visits.


RESULTS

A total of 1327 men (79.3\%) attended the second screening visit. Of these men, 13 (0.98\%) had a PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or greater, and three cancers were detected (cancer detection rate 0.23\%). At the third screening visit, 1017 men (76.8\%) attended, 34 men (3.3\%) had a PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or greater, and five cancers were detected (cancer detection rate 0.49\%). The 2344 subsequent PSA determinations in an 8-year period after the initial screening resulted in eight cancers detected, for an overall cancer detection rate of 0.47\%. Through linkage of all men with the cancer registry, no additional cancers were found.


CONCLUSIONS

A strategy of PSA screening every 8 years for men with a PSA level of 1.0 ng/mL or less will lead to a considerable decrease in the number of screening visits (with the associated costs and stress), with a minimal risk of missing aggressive cancer at a curable stage.},

We examined whether the early initiation of antiretroviral treatment affects residual HIV-1 viraemia. METHODS: Viraemia was measured using an assay with a detection limit of 3 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml in drug-naive patients who started antiretroviral therapy at the time of primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) (n = 10), during chronic infection without immune suppression (CD4 cell counts {\textgreater} or = 500/mm3; median 577) (n = 10), or after immune suppression developed (CD4 cell counts {\textless} 500/mm3; median 113) (n = 21). RESULTS: In 249 samples collected 24 to 120 weeks after treatment initiation, the mean proportion of samples with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 3 copies/ml was 75\% for PHI patients compared with 32 and 8\% for immunocompetent and immunosuppressed chronically infected patients, respectively. Fifty per cent of PHI patients, but none of the chronically infected patients, had persistently fewer than 3 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. PHI patients had lower residual HIV-1 RNA levels than chronically infected patients, and immunocompetent patients had lower residual HIV-1 RNA levels than immunosuppressed patients (all pairwise, P{\textless} 0.001). The mean residual HIV-1 RNA level was independently associated with the initiation of therapy during PHI and baseline CD4 cell counts (P {\textless} 0.001 for both associations). CONCLUSION: Viraemia levels are associated with clinical progression and predict virological treatment failure. The initiation of antiretroviral therapy at the time of PHI and while CD4 cell counts are high results in lower residual viraemia. These results support early antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected patients.}

METHODS: Estimates of the magnitude of mortality induced by exposure to hazardous substances in the Australian work-force were calculated by the proportionate attributable risk approach after careful consideration of options for methodological refinements. The main data sources used were unit mortality datasets (individual deidentified death records), and tabulations when these were unavailable. RESULTS: The estimated number of deaths that occurred in Australia each year from occupational exposure to hazardous substances was 2290; 78\% of these were men. The rate of mortality attributable to occupational exposure to hazardous substances was three to four times greater in male workers than in female workers. Male (productive) person-years of life lost (PYLL) were generally eight times higher than female PYLL. Cancer was the prime cause of death, followed by renal, cardiovascular, neurological, and chronic respiratory disease. Acute toxic episodes accounted for a small proportion of mortality but yielded a much larger proportion of PYLL, reflecting the relatively young ages of those who experienced fatal effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although national estimates of the proportions of mortality attributable to occupational exposure to hazardous substances seemed to be validly derived, uncertainties remain associated with the lack of an empirical basis for derivation of proportionate risk fractions used in the calculations. The finding of an appreciable burden of mortality that is attributable to past occupational exposure to hazardous substances emphasises the necessity for occupational health and safety authorities to measure and reduce worksite exposures. There is also an incentive to encourage the construction of appropriately designed cohort studies across industries and occupational groupings so that, ultimately, risk estimates may be directly calculated and applied to total workforce data for the definitive estimation of the magnitude of harm induced by occupational exposure to hazardous substances.}

METHODS: All patients who presented to a charity hospital gynecology clinic between July 1, 1994, and December 31, 1995, with a Papanicolaou test result of ASCUS or LSIL underwent repeat Papanicolaou test, cervicography, colposcopy with colposcopic-directed biopsy when appropriate, and an endocervical curettage. Pregnant patients and those who had undergone hysterectomy were excluded. The mean and median time from abnormal Papanicolaou test to clinical investigation was 61 and 58 days, respectively (range 6-162 days). RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven of the patients had an initial ASCUS Papanicolaou test. Of these 187, 24 (13\%) were found to have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades II-III. The second Papanicolaou test would have resulted in the detection of 11 of 24 lesions (sensitivity 46\%), whereas the cervigram would have detected 22 of 24 (sensitivity 92\%). The combined Papanicolaou test and cervigram sensitivity for ASCUS was 91\%. One hundred forty-one of the patients had an initial LSIL Papanicolaou test. Of these 141, 37 (26\%) patients were found to have CIN II-III. The repeat Papanicolaou test would have detected 29 of 37 lesions (sensitivity 78\%), whereas the cervigram would have detected 33 of 37 (sensitivity 89\%). The combined Papanicolaou test and cervigram sensitivity for LSIL was 97\%. CONCLUSION: Cervicography is a helpful adjunctive technique for detection of CIN II-III lesions in patients with previous ASCUS or LSIL Papanicolaou tests.}

We describe here 4 biomarkers, UDP-N-Acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine transferase (GalNAc-T3; not previously associated with PCa), PSMA, Hepsin and DD3/PCA3, which, in combination, distinguish prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). GalNAc-T3 was identified as overexpressed in PCa tissues by microarray analysis, confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and shown immunohistochemically to be localised to prostate epithelial cells with higher expression in malignant cells. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis across 21 PCa and 34 BPH tissues showed 4.6-fold overexpression of GalNAc-T3 (p = 0.005). The noncoding mRNA (DD3/PCA3) was overexpressed 140-fold (p = 0.007) in the cancer samples compared to BPH tissues. Hepsin was overexpressed 21-fold (p = 0.049, whereas the overexpression for PSMA was 66-fold (p = 0.047). When the gene expression data for these 4 biomarkers was combined in a logistic regression model, a predictive index was obtained that distinguished 100\% of the PCa samples from all of the BPH samples. Therefore, combining these genes in a real-time PCR assay represents a powerful new approach to diagnosing PCa by molecular profiling.

While this approach has been developed and promoted in engineering contexts for some time, it has more recently found a place in the mainstream of the study of chronic disease interventions such as cancer screening. The construction of a simulation model requires the specification of a model structure and sets of parameter values, both of which may have a considerable amount of uncertainty associated with them. This uncertainty is rarely quantified when reporting micro-simulation results. We suggest a Bayesian approach and assume a parametric probability distribution to mathematically express the uncertainty related to model parameters. First, we design a simulation experiment to achieve good coverage of the parameter space. Second, we model a response surface for the outcome of interest as a function of the model parameters using the simulation results. Third, we summarize the variability in the outcome of interest, including variation due to parameter uncertainty, using the response surface in combination with parameter probability distributions. We illustrate the proposed method with an application of a microsimulator designed to investigate the effect of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer mortality rates.}

The authors illustrate this along with some additional points regarding cohort matching. First, the impact of matching on efficiency can be in opposite directions for different measures of effect; as a consequence, criteria for deciding whether to match must depend on whether one wishes to estimate relative or absolute effects. Second, the commonly drawn analogy between blocking in randomized trials and matching in cohort studies is misleading when one considers the impact of matching on covariate distributions. Third, the conditions for efficiency overmatching in a cohort study are different from the conditions in a case-control study. It appears that, under an additive model, matching will usually increase the efficiency of both risk-difference and risk-ratio estimation, and the power of the Mantel-Haenszel test. Under a multiplicative model, the impact of matching is not as consistently beneficial. The authors present some approximate criteria which allow one to use a priori information to predict whether cohort matching is likely to improve efficiency.}

The authors propose a model-based approach to maximize the up-to-dateness of period estimates at minimal loss of precision. The approach is illustrated for monitoring of 5-year relative survival of patients diagnosed with one of 20 common forms of cancer in Finland between 1953 and 2002 by use of data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. It is shown that the model-based approach provides survival estimates that are as up-to-date as the most up-to-date conventional period estimates and at the same time much more precise than the latter. The modeling approach may further enhance the use of period analysis for deriving up-to-date cancer survival rates.}

Using data from the Finnish Cancer Registry, we show that modelling again strongly increases precision of survival estimates. Furthermore, special models adapted to the hybrid type of data are shown to provide even more precise and, in a clear majority of cases, also more valid predictions of survival of recently diagnosed patients than models ignoring the hybrid type of data. Finally, we show that model-based estimation of and testing for recent trends may give different answers if period rather than hybrid modelling is used for hybrid type of registry data. We conclude that modelling is useful for both hybrid and period analyses of cancer survival, but the different data structure needs to be taken into account in the set-up of models.}

This has been shown to be true in animal experiments and has been suggested on theoretical grounds for certain human cancers; it explains the evolution of lung cancer rates in relation to changing smoking habits but has not been demonstrated directly by human data. These results also suggest that mesothelioma incidence may not have been much underestimated in the past, which would imply that the recent marked increase in recorded rates is largely real and not merely a diagnostic artefact. The risk does not appear to have been much higher among men who were initially very heavily exposed. One possible explanation of this surprising observation is that chrysotile is eliminated, or ceases to be biologically active, more quickly than other types of asbestos.}

This study describes a method for projecting the number of screens to be performed by a mammographic screening programme, and applies this method in the context of New South Wales, Australia. METHOD: The total number of mammographic screens was projected as the sum of initial screens and re-screens, and is based on projections of the population, rates of new recruitment, rates of attrition within the programme, and the mix of screening intervals. The baseline scenario involved: 70\% participation of women aged 50-69 years, 90\% return rate for the second and subsequent re-screens, 5\% annual screens (95\% biennial screens), and a specified population projection. The results were assessed with respect to variations in these assumptions. RESULTS: The projections were strongly influenced by: the rate of screening of the target age group; the proportion of women re-screened annually; and the rates of attrition within the programme. Although demographic change had a notable effect, there was little difference between different population projections. Standard assumptions about attrition within the programme suggest that the current target participation rates in NSW may not be achieved in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: A practical model for projecting mammographic screens for populations is described which is capable of forecasting the number of screens under different scenarios. IMPLICATIONS: Projections of mammographic screens provide important information for the planning and financing of equipment and personnel, and for testing the effects of variations in important operational parameters. Re-screening attrition is an important contributor to screening viability.}

Successful treatment of acute HIV-1 infection leads to augmentation of these responses, but whether this enhances immune control has not been determined. We administered one or two supervised treatment interruptions to eight subjects with treated acute infection, with the plan to restart therapy if viral load exceeded 5,000 copies of HIV-1 RNA per millilitre of plasma (the level at which therapy has been typically recommended) for three consecutive weeks, or 50,000 RNA copies per ml at one time. Here we show that, despite rebound in viraemia, all subjects were able to achieve at least a transient steady state off therapy with viral load below 5,000 RNA copies per ml. At present, five out of eight subjects remain off therapy with viral loads of less than 500 RNA copies per ml plasma after a median 6.5 months (range 5-8.7 months). We observed increased virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and maintained T-helper-cell responses in all. Our data indicate that functional immune responses can be augmented in a chronic viral infection, and provide rationale for immunotherapy in HIV-1 infection.}

METHODS: T-lymphocyte subsets were analysed by two- and three-colour flow cytometry, and compared between HIV seroconverters (n = 16), HIV-infected (n = 18) and uninfected (n = 33) controls, patients with infectious mononucleosis (n = 7), and patients suspected clinically of having primary HIV infection but who were later found to be uninfected (referred to as HIV non-converters; n = 17). RESULTS: CD4+ lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in HIV seroconverters (mean, 444 x 10(6)/l) than in the HIV non-converters (793 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.003), HIV-seronegative controls (888 x 10(6)/l; P {\textless} 0.0001) and, to a lesser extent, those with mononucleosis (694 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.045). The reduction in CD4+ lymphocytes occurred in both the CD45RA+ (55\%) and CD45R0+ (33\%) subsets. CD8+ lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in HIV seroconverters (942 x 10(6)/l) than in HIV non-converters (570 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.003) and seronegative controls (467 x 10(6)/l; P {\textless} 0.0001), but significantly lower than in the mononucleosis group (3682 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.004). The CD8+ cells in the HIV seroconverters had increased coexpression of CD45R0, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD38 and CD11a/CD18. The mean CD4: CD8 ratio in the HIV seroconverters was 0.49, versus 1.52 in the non-converters (P {\textless} 0.0001), 2.08 in the seronegative patients (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 0.37 in the mononucleosis patients (P {\textgreater} 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Primary HIV infection is characterized by a depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes, especially of the CD45RA+ phenotype, and by an increase in CD8+ lymphocytes with an activated phenotype; the latter was also seen in patients with infectious mononucleosis but not in HIV non-converters or HIV-seronegative patients. Patients suspected clinically of having primary HIV infection but with normal T-cell phenotype are less likely to have primary HIV infection. These phenotypic changes, as well as an inverted CD4: CD8 ratio, can readily distinguish patients with primary HIV infection from HIV-uninfected patients except those with infectious mononucleosis. Therefore, T-cell-subset enumeration may be useful in the diagnosis of primary HIV infection.}

We examined the achievement of potassium balance through hemodialysis treatments and the associated fluctuations in serum potassium. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: A 3-yr (July 2001 to June 2004) cohort of 81,013 maintenance hemodialysis patients from all DaVita dialysis clinics across the United States were studied. Nine quarterly-averaged serum potassium groups ({\textless} 4.0, {\textgreater} or = 6.3 mEq/L and seven increments in-between) and four dialysate potassium concentration groups were created in each of the 12 calendar quarters. The death risk associated with predialysis potassium level and dialysate potassium concentration was examined using unadjusted, case-mix adjusted, and malnutrition-inflammation-adjusted time-dependent survival models. RESULTS: Serum potassium correlated with nutritional markers. Serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mEq/L was associated with the greatest survival, whereas potassium {\textless} 4.0 or {\textgreater} or = 5.6 mEq/L was associated with increased mortality. The death risk of serum potassium {\textgreater} or = 5.6 mEq/L remained consistent after adjustments. Higher dialysate potassium concentration was associated with increased mortality in hyperkalemic patients with predialysis serum potassium {\textgreater} or = 5.0 mEq/L. CONCLUSIONS: A predialysis serum potassium of 4.6 to 5.3 mEq/L is associated with the greatest survival in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemic patients who undergo maintenance hemodialysis against lower dialysate bath may have better survival. Limitations of observational studies including confounding by indication should be considered when interpreting these results.}

WT1 zinc fingers 2, 3 and 4 are highly homologous to the zinc fingers of the early growth response gene, EGR1. However, only WT1--KTS is capable of binding an EGR1 consensus site. In contrast, the previously described genomic fragment, +P5 (D1S3309E), is bound by both WT1--KTS and WT1 + KTS. In this study, the region within + P5 to which both WT1 -- KTS and WT1 + KTS bind was defined as 5'- GGAGAGGGAGGATC-3'. EGR1 did not bind + P5. By creating zinc finger deletions, we demonstrate that zinc finger 1, but not zinc finger 4, is critical for + P5 binding; whereas zinc finger 4, but not 1, is necessary for the binding of WT1 target sites within EGR1, PDGF A chain and IGF2 promoters. Thus, zinc finger usage can vary with target and + P5 may represent a novel type of WT1 binding site, the physiological relevance of which must be investigated},

	annote = {Cancer incidence and mortality estimates for 1995 are presented for the 38 countries in the four United Nations-defined areas of Europe, using World Health Organization mortality data and published estimates of incidence from national cancer registries. Additional estimation was required where national incidence data was not available, and the method involved incorporating the high quality incidence and mortality data available from the expanding number of population-based cancer registries in Europe. There were an estimated 2.6 million new cases of cancer in Europe in 1995, representing over one-quarter of the world burden of cancer. The corresponding number of deaths from cancer was approximately 1.6 million. After adjusting for differing population age structures, overall incidence rates in men were highest in the Western European countries (420.9 per 100,000), with only Austria having a rate under 400. Eastern European men had the second highest rates of cancer (414.2), with extremely high rates being observed in Hungary (566.6) and in the Czech Republic (480.5). The lowest male all-cancer rate by area was observed in the Northern European countries, with fairly low rates seen in Sweden (356.6) and the UK (377.8). In contrast to men, the highest rates in women were observed in Northern Europe (315.9) and were particularly high in Denmark (396.2) and the other Nordic countries excepting Finland. The rates of cancer in Eastern European women were lower than in the other three areas, although as with men, female rates were very high in Hungary (357.2) and in the Czech Republic (333.6). There was greater disparity in the mortality rates within Europe--generally, rates were highest in Eastern European countries, notably in Hungary, reflecting a combination of poorer cancer survival rates and a higher incidence of the more lethal neoplasms, notably cancer of the lung. Lung cancer, with an estimated 377,000 cases, was the most common cancer in Europe in 1995. Rates were particularly high in much of Eastern Europe reflecting current and past tobacco smoking habits of many of its inhabitants. Together with cancers of colon and rectum (334,000), and female breast (321,000), the three cancers represented approximately 40\% of new cases in Europe. In men, the most common primary sites were lung (22\% of all cancer cases), colon and rectum (12\%) and prostate (11\%), and in females, breast (26\%), colon and rectum (14\%) and stomach (7\%). The number of deaths is determined by survival, as well as incidence; by far the most common cause of death was lung cancer (330,000)--about one-fifth of the total number of cancer deaths in Europe in 1995. Deaths from cancers of the colon and rectum (189,000) ranked second, followed by deaths from stomach cancer (152,000), which due to poorer survival ranked higher than breast cancer (124,000). Lung cancer was the most common cause of death from cancer in men (29\%). Breast cancer was the leading cause of death in females (17\%). Cancer registries are a unique source of information on cancer incidence and survival, and are used here with national mortality to demonstrate the very substantial burden of cancer in Europe, and the scope for prevention. Despite some provisos about data quality, the general patterns which emerge in Europe verify the role of past exposures and interventions, and more importantly, firmly establish the need for cancer control measures which target specific populations. In particular, there is a clear urgency to combat the ongoing tobacco epidemic, now prevalent in much of Europe, particularly in the Eastern countries.}

We assessed the screening characteristics of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement after correction for verification bias. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2001, 6691 men underwent PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. Of these men, 705 (11 percent) subsequently underwent biopsy of the prostate. Under the assumption that the chance of undergoing a biopsy depends only on the PSA-test result and other observed clinical variables, we used a mathematical model to estimate adjusted receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Adjusting for verification bias significantly increased the area under the ROC curve (i.e., the overall diagnostic performance) of the PSA test, as compared with an unadjusted analysis (0.86 vs. 0.69, P{\textless}0.001, for men less than 60 years of age; 0.72 vs. 0.62, P=0.008, for men 60 years of age or older). If the threshold PSA value for undergoing biopsy were set at 4.1 ng per milliliter, 82 percent of cancers in younger men and 65 percent of cancers in older men would be missed. A digital rectal examination that is abnormal but not suspicious for cancer does not affect the overall performance characteristics of the test. CONCLUSIONS: A lower threshold level of PSA for recommending prostate biopsy, particularly in younger men, may improve the clinical value of the PSA test.},

At autopsy, six cases previously thought to be dying from lung cancer were found to have died from other diseases (false positive rate = 5\%). Twelve lung cancer deaths were also found to have been missed, a false negative rate of 9\%, which was similar for adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma cases. Our findings confirmed the expectation expressed earlier that death certification of lung cancer would be more accurate in an institute specializing in chest diseases, to which patients had to be fit enough to be transferred, than in two general hospitals in Budapest. Nevertheless, since most cases certified as dying from lung cancer die without the benefits available in the specialized institute, the estimated false negative and positive rates for lung cancer death certification in Hungary remain high, at an estimated 56\% and 30\%, respectively. The much lower autopsy rates in most other countries than in Hungary points to there being considerable inaccuracy in lung cancer mortality rates internationally.}

METHODS: We used a population-based simulation model to evaluate the incremental societal costs and benefits in Thailand of seven screening techniques, including visual inspection of the cervix after applying acetic acid (VIA), human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap smear, and combinations of screening tests, and examined the discounted costs per year of life saved (LYS). RESULTS: Compared with no (i.e., not well-organized) screening, all strategies saved lives, at costs ranging from 121 US dollars to 6720 US dollars per LYS, and reduced mortality, by up to 58\%. Comparing each strategy with the next least expensive alternative, VIA performed at 5-year intervals in women of ages 35-55 with immediate treatment if abnormalities are found was the least expensive option and saved the greatest number of lives, with a cost of 517 US dollars per LYS. HPV screening resulted in similar costs and benefits, if the test cost is 5 US dollars and if 90\% of women undergo follow-up after an abnormal screen. Cytology (Pap smear) was a reasonable alternative if sensitivity exceeds 80\% and if 90\% of women undergo follow-up. Compared with no screening, use of a combination of Pap smear and HPV testing at 5-year intervals in women of ages 20-70 could achieve greater than 90\% reduction in cervical cancer mortality at a cost of 1683 US dollars per LYS, and VIA could achieve 83\% reduction at 524 US dollars per LYS. CONCLUSIONS: Well-organized screening programs can reduce cervical cancer mortality in less-developed countries at low costs. These cost-effectiveness data can enhance decision-making about optimal policies for a given setting.}

The cure fraction (the proportion of patients cured of disease) is of interest to patients and is a useful measure to monitor trends in survival of curable disease. There are 2 main types of cure fraction model, the mixture cure fraction model and the non-mixture cure fraction model, with most previous work concentrating on the mixture cure fraction model. In this paper, we extend the parametric non-mixture cure fraction model to incorporate background mortality, thus providing estimates of the cure fraction in population-based cancer studies. We compare the estimates of relative survival and the cure fraction between the 2 types of model and also investigate the importance of modeling the ancillary parameters in the selected parametric distribution for both types of model.}

In observational epidemiology, however, controllable confounding and random error are sometimes only a fraction of the total error, and are rarely if ever the only important source of uncertainty. Potential biases due to unmeasured confounders, classification errors, and selection bias need to be addressed in any thorough discussion of study results. METHODS: This paper reviews basic methods for examining the sensitivity of study results to biases, with a focus on methods that can be implemented without computer programming. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analysis is helpful in obtaining a realistic picture of the potential impact of biases.}

We analyzed serum samples of 300 cases diagnosed between 1987 and 1998, and 300 matched controls. Higher concentrations of testosterone (T) were not associated with increased prostate cancer risk. Relative to men with levels in the lowest fourth of the distribution, men in the upper fourth of total T had a risk of 0.82 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-1.29]. The corresponding relative risks for free T (0.72; 95\% CI, 0.45-1.14), percentage of free T (0.74; 95\% CI, 0.46-1.19), and total T:sex hormone binding globulin ratio (0.52; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.83) similarly were not elevated. Higher concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide were weakly associated with risk. Relative risks associated with being in the highest fourth for androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide were 1.20 (95\% CI, 0.76-1.89), 1.38 (95\% CI, 0.86-2.21), and 1.27 (95\% CI, 0.80-2.00), respectively. Men in the upper fourth of total estradiol (E2), free E2 and percentage of free E2 had relative risks of 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.42-1.13), 0.52 (95\% CI, 0.33-0.82), and 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.40-1.05), respectively. The inverse association between E2 and prostate cancer risk was largely restricted to men with blood collection within 3 years of diagnosis. Our results add to the evidence that serum testosterone is unrelated to prostate cancer incidence. The suggestions that intraprostatic androgen activity may increase risk and that serum estrogens may decrease risk, warrant additional study.}

We estimated net costs of care for elderly cancer patients in the United States for the 18 most prevalent cancers and for all other tumor sites combined. METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare files to identify 718,907 cancer patients and 1,623,651 noncancer control subjects. Within each tumor site, noncancer control subjects were matched to patients by sex, age group, geographic location, and phase of care (ie, initial, continuing, and last year of life). Costs of care were estimated for each phase by use of Medicare claims data from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2003. Per-patient net costs of care were applied to the 5-year survival of cancer patients by phase of care to estimate 5-year costs of care and extrapolated to the elderly US Medicare population diagnosed with cancer in 2004. RESULTS: Across tumor sites, mean net costs of care were highest in the initial and last year of life phases of care and lowest in the continuing phase. Mean 5-year net costs varied widely, from less than \$20,000 for patients with breast cancer or melanoma of the skin to more than \$40,000 for patients with brain or other nervous system, esophageal, gastric, or ovarian cancers or lymphoma. For elderly cancer patients diagnosed in 2004, aggregate 5-year net costs of care to Medicare were estimated to be approximately \$21.1 billion. Costs to Medicare were highest for lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers, reflecting underlying incidence, stage distribution at diagnosis, survival, and phase-specific costs for these tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The costs of cancer care to Medicare are substantial and vary by tumor site, phase of care, stage at diagnosis, and survival.}

The results showed that defining exposure as "ever/never" screened produced, as expected, a serious bias in favor of screening. Defining exposure as being screened no later than the time the case's cancer is diagnosed has a serious bias against screening. An alternative exposure definition--screening can occur no later than the time the case would have been clinically diagnosed--eliminates the bias against screening. Further, the results showed that the type of age matching and the time scale used can produce a bias against screening and that this bias can be quite strong when case-control studies are performed in populations with a periodic screening program that is the only source of screening. Finally, control eligibility criteria had little effect.}

A simple model is used in which mortality (all-ages and premature) is the dependent variable, and deprivation, morbidity and other socio-economic indicators are the explanatory variables. Deprivation is measured by the Townsend index; the other socio-economic variables are the median income, unequal income distribution (Gini coefficient) and population density. Morbidity is estimated on the basis of hospital admission rates and overweight prevalence. Spatial autocorrelation is measured by the Moran's I coefficient. All mortality and morbidity variables have significant, positive, and moderate-to-high spatial autocorrelation. Two multivariate models are explored: a weighted least-squares model ignoring spatial autocorrelation and a simultaneous autoregressive model. The paper concludes that spatial autocorrelation has a significant impact on the relationship between mortality and socio-economic variables. Future ecological models intended to inform health resources allocation need to pay greater attention to the spatial dimension of the data used.}

Survival after myocardial infarction (MI) is generally assessed using all-cause or cause-specific methods. Neither method is able to assess the impact of the disease or condition of interest in comparison with expected survival in a similar population. Relative survival, the ratio of the observed and the expected survival rates, is applied routinely in cancer studies and may improve on current methods for assessment of survival in CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cohort of subjects after a first recorded acute MI, we discuss the application of relative survival in CHD and illustrate a number of the key issues. We compare the findings from relative survival with those obtained using Cox proportional and non-proportional hazards models in standard all-cause survival. Estimated survival rates are higher using relative survival models compared with all-cause methods. CONCLUSION: Estimates obtained from all-cause mortality fail to disentangle mortality associated with the condition of interest from that due to all other causes. Relative survival gives an estimate of survival due to the disease of interest without the need for cause of death information.},

A national mammography screening programme is being considered for New Zealand, and pilot programmes were established in two regions (Otago/Southland and Waikato) in 1991 to determine the potential costs and benefits of mammography for New Zealand women. The aim of this paper is to explore the cost-effectiveness of mammography screening in New Zealand relative to no screening, and to examine the marginal change in costs and benefits of altering programme characteristics such as the age of women invited and screening frequency. Cost-effectiveness is measured by the net cost (the costs of screening minus the treatment savings averted by the early detection of cancers) per year of life gained, from the perspective of the public health care sector. A microsimulation computer model, MICROLIFE, was developed to facilitate the estimation of mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness. The results show that, while mammography screening does not 'save money' overall, the cost per year of life saved for a range of policies compares favourably with other New Zealand health services, and is comparable to the results from economic evaluations of mammography screening overseas. Of those regimes considered, screening women 50-64 years of age at 3-yearly intervals appears to be most cost-effective.}

We used the two-stage clonal expansion model incorporating the ideas of initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion to analyze lung cancer mortality in three large cohorts, the British Doctors' cohort and the two American Cancer Society cohorts, to determine how smoking habits influence age-specific lung cancer rates via these mechanisms. Likelihood ratio tests indicate that smoking-related promotion is the dominant model mechanism associated with lung cancer mortality in all cohorts. Smoking-related initiation is less important than promotion but interacts synergistically with it. Although no information on ex-smokers is available in these data, the model with estimated variables can be used to project risks among ex-smokers. These projected risks are in good agreement with the risk among ex-smokers derived from other studies. We present 10-year projected risks for current and former smokers adjusted for competing causes of mortality. The importance of smoking duration on lung cancer risk in these cohorts is a direct consequence of promotion. Intervention and treatment strategies should focus on promotion as the primary etiologic mechanism in lung carcinogenesis.}

The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies. Human papillomavirus DNA testing also appears to represent a significant enhancement for detection of endocervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect and prevent. Human papillomavirus DNA testing, when used in conjunction with cervical cytology, can significantly reduce risk to both the patient and the laboratory.}

Carcinogenesis models provide one type of information that can result in a unique set of parameters for the effects of age, period and cohort. We use the multistage carcinogenesis model and its extensions to obtain a unique set of parameters for an age-period-cohort model of lung cancer trends of Connecticut males and females from 1935 to 1988. Some of these models do not seem to provide a reasonable set of model parameters, but we found that a model that included second-order terms and a multistage mixture model both gave a good fit to the data and realistic parameter estimates.}

We assessed whether the prognostic value of plasma virus levels was different according to the CD4 count. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients followed for a median of 2.91 years (range, 0.02-4.54). SETTING: Department of Infectious Diseases at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 255 HIV-infected individuals with an initial measurement of CD4 lymphocyte count and plasma HIV RNA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival time. RESULTS: The plasma HIV RNA (median 101410 copies/ml; range (range 200-7200000) and the CD4 lymphocyte count (median 250 cells x 10(6)/l; range 1-1247) were negatively correlated (Pearson r = -0.53; P {\textless} 0.00001). Of the 255 patients, 110 died during follow-up. Overall, a higher HIV RNA level was associated with increased risk of death, but the association was smaller in patients with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts (test for interaction P {\textless} 0.0001). In patients with CD4 count below 50 cells x 10(6)/l the association between HIV RNA and risk of death was not statistically significant (relative hazard per 10-fold higher HIV RNA level was 1.53; P = 0.11; adjusted for age and CD4 count) while that between the CD4 count and risk of death was highly significant (relative hazard per 50\% lower CD4 count 1.38; P = 0.005; adjusted for age and HIV RNA level). CONCLUSIONS: Patients were relatively lightly treated with antiretroviral drugs both before and during this study. In this situation, it appears that the HIV RNA level has a relatively weak association with risk of death in patients with advanced HIV infection and that the CD4 lymphocyte count is probably more useful in assessing prognosis},

DESIGN AND METHODS: HIV RNA levels were measured approximately 2.5 years after seroconversion in 97 haemophilic men followed for up to 17 years. Levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgA and IgG were measured within 1 year of the HIV RNA level. The relationships between these markers and progression to AIDS and death were studied using Kaplan-Meier plots and proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: High HIV RNA levels were associated with faster progression to AIDS and shorter survival in univariate Cox regression models. High IgA and IgG levels were also associated with faster disease progression. In multivariate models, high HIV RNA levels remained independently associated with faster disease progression [relative hazard (RH), 1.86; P = 0.01 for AIDS; RH, 1.66; P = 0.05 for death). However, high IgA and IgG levels provided strong independent prognostic information for AIDS and death (IgA: RH, 1.38; P = 0.006 for AIDS; RH, 1.33; P = 0.07 for death; IgG: RH, 1.10; P = 0.02 for AIDS; RH, 1.12; P = 0.01 for death). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the importance of the HIV RNA level in assessing the long-term prognosis in individuals infected with HIV. However, our results suggest that immune activation markers, rather than merely reflecting high HIV RNA levels are important in assessing prognosis in their own right. These findings may improve our understanding of HIV pathogenesis and may aid clinical management of patients},

It is activated via a three-step enzymatic pathway, the final step of which requires thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme that is significantly more active in tumor than normal tissue. As an oral agent, capecitabine is more convenient for patients and medical personnel, and avoids the complications associated with venous access. This paper reviews the development and clinical experience of capecitabine in breast cancer treatment. Clinical trials have established the efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer, showing that capecitabine is an effective therapy for patients who have exhausted all established treatment options. Moreover, randomized, phase II studies have demonstrated that capecitabine is effective in anthracycline-pretreated patients and as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. In addition to its confirmed efficacy, the favorable safety profile of capecitabine, particularly the low myelosuppression rate, makes it an attractive agent for incorporation into combination regimens. Therefore numerous trials have assessed the feasibility of capecitabine-containing regimens, and have shown promising results. Capecitabine is an important new treatment option for breast cancer patients, and ongoing clinical trials should further define its role in a range of settings.}

Sympathoactivation may be one of the mechanisms linking intra-abdominal obesity to hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a functional variation in the androgen-receptor gene (AR, a variable number of CAG repeats in exon 1) is associated with intra-abdominal adiposity, sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone, and blood pressure in adolescent boys but not girls. We studied 223 boys and 259 girls (age 12 to 18 years) from a French-Canadian founder population. Intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous-abdominal fat were quantified with an MRI. Blood pressure was recorded beat-to-beat during an hour-long protocol including physical and mental challenges, and these blood pressure time series were used to assess sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone by power spectral analysis. The results showed that boys with a "low" versus "intermediate" or "high" CAG-repeat number in AR demonstrated higher intra-abdominal fat (by 28\% and 48\%, respectively) but not subcutaneous-abdominal fat. These intra-abdominal fat differences remained significant after adjusting for serum levels of sex hormones and subcutaneous-abdominal fat. Furthermore, boys with low versus intermediate or high CAG-repeat numbers also showed higher blood pressure, with the differences being most pronounced during mental stress (8.0 and 8.5 mm Hg, respectively) and higher sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone. As expected, no such differences were seen among girls. In adolescent boys, low CAG-repeat numbers in AR may be a genetic risk factor for intra-abdominal obesity and hypertension; sympathoactivation may be an underlying link between the 2 conditions.},

METHODS: To estimate the national prevalence of survivors of childhood cancers, we used data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program from 1975 to 2004. Long-term childhood cancer survivors, diagnosed before 1975, were estimated using incidence and survival models extrapolated into years before 1975. RESULTS: We estimated that there are a total of 328,652 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States as of January 1, 2005, of these, 24\% have survived {\textgreater}30 years since diagnosis. The cancer sites with the largest number of survivors are brain (51,650), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49,271), germ cell tumors (34,169), and Hodgkin lymphoma (31,598). Sites with higher proportions of survivors diagnosed {\textgreater}30 years ago are germ cell (43\%), soft tissue (38\%), renal (34\%), and bone (26\%). Historical trends from Connecticut data show major improvements in survival for all of the childhood cancer sites. CONCLUSION: The number of survivors of childhood cancers is expected to increase in the future consequent to the lifesaving advances in treatment introduced after 1970, especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Because this population is at increased risk for illness-related morbidity and mortality, appreciating the number of survivors who were treated as children is important both to determining the national cancer burden and planning for the future health care needs of these individuals.}

METHODS: Standard non-parametric survival methods were used to estimate the AIDS incubation period distribution. The practical importance of each type of bias was assessed using various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The potential sources of bias of most practical importance in this study were the right-censoring strategy and that due to lack of documentation of a negative HIV antibody test. Five different right-censoring strategies gave estimates of the median time to AIDS ranging from 8.1 to 10.8 years for the 1202 individuals enrolled in the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters. HIV-infected persons with a history of a previous antibody negative test which could not be verified appeared to progress to AIDS more rapidly than persons with such verification (Relative risk = 1.8, 95\% confidence intervals = 1.3-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: As a number of possible causes of bias can impact on results, care must be taken to document them and control for them wherever possible. In our study, this was particularly relevant in relation to the documentation of a previous HIV antibody negative test and the choice of analysis cut-off dates. As methods may differ between cohorts, comparison of the published results from one cohort with those of another may be misleading},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Patients with newly diagnosed cancer may request an estimate of their prospects for long-term survival. Unfortunately, standard estimates of survival may be outdated, because they do not reflect recent advances. The authors present a projection method that incorporates trends in survival and provides more up-to-date estimates of long-term survival for newly diagnosed patients. METHODS: The projection method fits a regression model to interval relative survival and includes a parameter associated with a trend on diagnosis year. The cumulative relative survival rate (CRS) in a target year is calculated by multiplying the projected interval survival rates for that year. To investigate the predictive ability of the projection approach and to develop model-selection rules, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and the Connecticut tumor registry were used to recreate data that were available at a particular time in the past, and those data were used to project survival for specified target years. RESULTS: The projection method was better at predicting the survival of recently diagnosed patients than current methods, especially long-term survival for patients who had disease sites with an increasing and stable trend in survival. The authors predicted that the 15-year CRS for patients who were diagnosed in 2003 will be 61\% for all cancer sites combined, 57\% for colorectal cancer, 82\% for female breast cancer, 53\% for ovarian cancer, and 97\% for prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Although the projection method was more speculative than other methods that are aligned more closely with current observed data, it offered the possibility of providing improved estimates of long-term survival for recently diagnosed patients. Caution should be used when applying these methods for cancer sites where there has been a dramatic uptake of screening, e.g., prostate cancer, for which the projected results may be overly optimistic.}

Two thousand and twenty patients (65\%) were receiving at least 1 ARV drug at the time of the study.

Of patients on ARV therapy, 34\% received open-label combination therapy. This proportion was higher in central Europe compared with other regions (27\%, 50\%, and 31\% for southern, central, and northern Europe, respectively, p {\textless} 0.0001). Primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was used by 85\% of patients with a CD4 count {\textless}200 cells/microl, without marked regional differences. In patients without esophageal candidiasis or other invasive fungal infections, antifungal drugs were far less frequently used in patients from southern and central Europe compared with patients from northern Europe (10\%, 10\%, and 25\%, respectively, p {\textless} 0.0001). Only 5\% of patients with a CD4 count {\textless}100 cells/microl received rifabutine as primary prophylaxis against nontuberculous mycobacterioses. ARV and antifungal therapies are used differently in different parts of Europe, whereas primary PCP prophylaxis is uniformly administered to most at-risk patients.

The demographic characteristics, the epidemiology and natural history of the disease, and the characteristics of screening are defined in the input. All kinds of assumptions on the natural history of colorectal cancer and screening and surveillance strategies can easily be incorporated in the model. MISCAN-COLON gives detailed output of incidence, prevalence and mortality, and the results and effects of screening. It can be used to test hypotheses about the natural history of colorectal cancer, such as the duration of progressive adenomas, and screening characteristics, such as sensitivity of tests, against empirical data. In decision making about screening, the model can be used for evaluation of screening policies, and for choosing between competing policies by comparing their simulated incremental costs and effectiveness outcomes.}

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival after the time of diagnosis. RESULTS--The median survival after diagnosis was 17 months, with an estimated survival at three years of 16\% (95\% confidence interval 15\% to 17\%). Patients diagnosed in southern Europe had a shorter survival, particularly immediately after the time of diagnosis, compared with patients diagnosed in central and northern Europe (survival at one year (95\% confidence interval) 54\% (52\% to 56\%) 66\% (64\% to 68\%), 65\% (63\% to 66\%), respectively. The three year survival, however, was similar for all regions. The regional differences in survival were less pronounced for patients diagnosed in 1989 compared with earlier years. Improved survival in recent years was observed for patients with a variety of manifestations used to define AIDS but was significant only for patients diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The three year survival, however, remains unchanged over time. CONCLUSIONS--Survival of AIDS patients seems to vary within Europe, being shorter in southern than central and northern Europe. The magnitude of these differences, however, has declined gradually over time. Short term survival has improved in recent years, but the long term prognosis has remained equally poor, reflecting the fact that the underlying infection with HIV and many of the complicating diseases remains essentially uncontrolled},

Equally dramatic has been the emergence of around-the-clock economies, altering the way work is organised, especially working time. Many more children now live in households where one or both parents work non-standard hours (evenings, nights or on weekends).Are there any implications for children's well-being when parents work non-standard schedules? There has been virtually no investigation of how children are faring in these around-the-clock households, despite evidence that nonstandard work times affect family functioning and are stressful for parents. Using data from a representative sample of 4433 dual-earner Canadian families and their 2-11-year-old children (N children = 6361), we compared families where both parents worked standard hours, with families where one or both worked non-standard times (evenings, nights or weekends). In nearly three-quarters of the families one or both parents regularly worked non-standard times. We found associations between children's well-being and parent work schedules, with higher odds ratios for child difficulties when parents worked non-standard times. These associations persisted after adjusting for several confounding factors including socio-economic status, parent part-time or full-time work, and childcare use, and were evident whether mothers, fathers or both parents worked non-standard times. The findings raise questions about the implications for children of the 24-h economy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

It is typically done by using a numerical weather prediction model, perturbing the inputs to the model in various ways, and running the model for each perturbed set of inputs. The result is then viewed as an ensemble of forecasts, taken to be a sample from the joint probability distribution of the future weather quantities of interest. This is typically not feasible for mesoscale weather prediction carried out locally by organizations without the vast data and computing resources of national weather centers. Instead, we propose a simpler method that breaks with much previous practice by perturbing the outputs, or deterministic forecasts, from the model. Forecast errors are modeled using a geostatistical model, and ensemble members are generated by simulating realizations of the geostatistical model. The method is applied to 48-hour mesoscale forecasts of temperature in the North American Pacific Northwest between 2000 and 2002. The resulting forecast intervals turn out to be empirically well calibrated for individual meteorological quantities, to be sharper than those obtained from approximate climatology, and to be consistent with aspects of the spatial correlation structure of the observations.}

METHODS: Collection of plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte data at 3-6 monthly time intervals over 2 years. RESULTS: Seventy-three subjects (54\%) achieved suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels below 400 copies/ml during the observation period, 31 individuals (23\%) had detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and 31 subjects (23\%) had virological failures with viral loads above 10,000 copies/mL. Median CD4+ T lymphocytes increased from 246 to 463 x 10(6) cells/l, showing a median rise of 20 x 10(6) cells/l per month in the first 3 months and 7 x 10(6) cells/l per month thereafter. The proportion of individuals who reached CD4+ cell counts above 500 x 10(6) cells/l increased from 8\% at baseline to 54\% at 2 years. Treatment-naive individuals, subjects with a large reduction of HIV-1 RNA or a large early CD8+ increase had better early CD4+ responses. Long-term CD4+ T-cell increases were inversely correlated with mean plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Baseline CD4+ T-cell count was the most important determinant of reaching CD4+ cell counts above 500 x 10(6) cells/l. Nineteen per cent of subjects had no further CD4+ T-cell increases in the second year of therapy despite undetectable viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Immune reconstitution is a slow process, showing a large individual variability. The virological response to HAART was the most important determinant of the immunological short- and long-term response.}

METHODS: The estimates were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach, to derive incidence and prevalence starting from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian Cancer Registries were modeled in order to estimate regional and national cancer survival. RESULTS: Cancer time trends resulted more favorable in northern-central regions than in southern regions, both for men and women. Mortality started to decrease in the northern-central area approximately from the mid 1980s, whereas it was expected to slightly decline only after the year 2000 in the southern area. Incidence was estimated to decrease in men from 1995 in northern and central areas only; no incidence reduction is expected for women during the study period. Overall, 130,000 cancer deaths, 250,000 new cancer cases and 1,700,000 prevalent cancer cases are estimated in Italy in the year 2005. CONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date picture of cancer risk and burden in the Italian regions shows as a relevant epidemiological change is ongoing in Italy. Although a clear geographical variability in mortality and morbidity levels still exists across the country, the historical North-to-South gap appears smaller than in the past. This change is particularly remarkable for men, as a consequence of trends that are favorable in northern-central regions but not yet in southern regions.}

METHODS: Age-eligible women with nonurgent conditions and without recent screening were offered screening by a nurse. A decision analysis compared the costs and outcomes of emergency room screening and standard hospital screening efforts. RESULTS: The undiscounted cost-effectiveness results for establishing new programs were \$4050 (cervical cancer), \$403,203 (breast cancer), and \$4375 (joint cervix and breast cancer) per year of life saved. If screening is added to an existing program, results are more favorable (\$429, \$21,324, and \$479 per year of life saved for cervix, breast, and joint screening, respectively). Results were most sensitive to volume and probability of receiving treatment after an abnormal screen. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency room screening was cost-effective for cervical cancer; breast cancer screening was relatively expensive given the low number of women reached. More intensive recruitment and follow-up strategies are needed to maximize the cost-effectiveness of such programs.}

Genomic DNA from 162 patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 251 healthy men randomly selected from the population were typed for five nonsynonymous DNA repair markers. We found that the XRCC1-Arg399Gln AA and the MGMT-Leu84Phe CT+TT genotypes were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.18; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-4.81 and OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.19-3.34, respectively]. In contrast, XRCC3-Thr241Met, XPD-Lys751Gln, and MGMT-Ile143Val markers showed no significant associations with risk, although due to the much lower frequency of their variant alleles in this population we cannot rule out small to modest effects. There was a significant interaction between the MGMT-84 marker and insulin resistance (P(interaction) = 0.046). Relative to men with the MGMT-84 CC genotype and a low insulin resistance ({\textless}0.097), those having the CT-TT genotype and a greater insulin resistance had a 5.4-fold risk (OR, 5.39; 95\% CI, 2.46-11.82). In addition, for the XRCC3-241 marker, relative to men with the CC genotype and a low intake of preserved foods ({\textless}12.7 g/d), those harboring the CT+TT genotype and having a higher intake of preserved foods ({\textgreater}12.7 g/d), which contain nitrosamines and nitrosamine precursors, had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer risk (OR, 2.62; 95\% CI, 1.13-6.06). In contrast, men with the CT+TT genotype and a low intake of preserved foods had a 69\% reduction in risk (OR, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.96; P(interaction) = 0.005). These results suggest that genetic variants in the DNA repair pathways may be involved in prostate cancer etiology and that other risk factors, including preserved foods and insulin resistance, may modulate prostate cancer risk in combination with genetic susceptibility in these repair pathways. Replication in larger studies is necessary to preclude chance findings, particularly those among subgroups, and clarify the mechanisms involved.}

The study design was a meta-analysis using data pooled from published sources. Studies published between January 1986 and March 1998 were eligible for inclusion if they included data on neoplasia (cytology-based), HIV (defined by laboratory and/or standard clinical criteria), and HPV (assessed by PCR, Southern blot, dot-blot hybridization, or cytology of an otherwise well designed study) among nonpregnant women. Blinded data abstraction was performed independently by the investigators. There were 15 studies that were eligible and presented data in a format that could be abstracted for analysis. Data were pooled using a Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio (OR); generalized estimation regression equations were used to examine independent effects of HIV and HPV. Overall, based on the Mantel-Haenszel ORs, there was a strong overall association between HPV and neoplasia [OR, 8.1; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 6.5-10.1]. Stratifying by HIV status, HIV-positive women had higher odds of disease (OR, 8.8; 95\% CI, 6.3-12.5) than HIV-negative women (OR, 5.0; 95\% CI, 3.7-6.8). In the regression model, there was an interaction between HPV and HIV (P = 0.01); immunosuppression also tended to predict neoplasia (P = 0.058). HIV seems to be a cofactor in the association between HPV and cervical neoplasia; this effect may vary by level of immune function. These speculations are biologically plausible. Additional data from large, well designed studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.}

We examined the change in these mortality rates of HIV-1-infected patients across Europe during 1994-98, and assessed the extent to which changes can be explained by the use of new therapeutic regimens. METHODS: We analysed data from EuroSIDA, which is a prospective, observational, European, multicentre cohort of 4270 HIV-1-infected patients. We compared death rates in each 6 month period from September, 1994, to March, 1998. FINDINGS: By March, 1998, 1215 patients had died. The mortality rate from March to September, 1995, was 23.3 deaths per 100 person-years of follow-up (95\% CI 20.6-26.0), and fell to 4.1 per 100 person-years of follow-up (2.3-5.9) between September, 1997, and March, 1998. From March to September, 1997, the death rate was 65.4 per 100 person-years of follow-up for those on no treatment, 7.5 per 100 person-years of follow-up for patients on dual therapy, and 3.4 per 100 person-years of follow-up for patients on triple-combination therapy. Compared with patients who were followed up from September, 1994, to March, 1995, patients seen between September, 1997, and March, 1998, had a relative hazard of death of 0.16 (0.08-0.32), which rose to 0.90 (0.50-1.64) after adjustment for treatment. INTERPRETATION: Death rates across Europe among patients infected with HIV-1 have been falling since September, 1995, and at the beginning of 1998 were less than a fifth of their previous level. A large proportion of the reduction in mortality could be explained by new treatments or combinations of treatments},

SETTING: Pathology laboratory in Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 55,164 split sample pairs (liquid based sample collected after conventional sample from one collection) from consecutive samples of women choosing both types of cytology and whose specimens were examined between August 2004 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was accuracy of slides for detecting squamous lesions. Secondary outcomes were rate of unsatisfactory slides, distribution of squamous cytological classifications, and accuracy of detecting glandular lesions. RESULTS: Fewer unsatisfactory slides were found for imager read cytology than for conventional cytology (1.8\% v 3.1\%; P{\textless}0.001). More slides were classified as abnormal by imager read cytology (7.4\% v 6.0\% overall and 2.8\% v 2.2\% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 1 or higher). Among 550 patients in whom imager read cytology was cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or higher and conventional cytology was less severe than grade 1, 133 of 380 biopsy samples taken were high grade histology. Among 294 patients in whom imager read cytology was less severe than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 and conventional cytology was grade 1 or higher, 62 of 210 biopsy samples taken were high grade histology. Imager read cytology therefore detected 71 more cases of high grade histology than did conventional cytology, resulting from 170 more biopsies. Similar results were found when one pathologist reread the slides, masked to cytology results. CONCLUSION: The ThinPrep Imager detects 1.29 more cases of histological high grade squamous disease per 1000 women screened than conventional cytology, with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 as the threshold for referral to colposcopy. More imager read slides than conventional slides were satisfactory for examination and more contained low grade cytological abnormalities.}

The microsimulation model POHEM was adapted to simulate CRC screening using Canadian data and RCT results about test sensitivity and specificity, participation, incidence, staging, progression, mortality and direct health care costs. In Canada, biennial screening of 67\% of individuals aged 50-74 in the year 2000 resulted in an estimated 10-year CRC mortality reduction of 16.7\%. The life expectancy of the cohort increased by 15 days on average and the demand for colonoscopy rose by 15\% in the first year. The estimated cost of screening was \$112 million per year or \$11,907 per life-year gained (discounted at 5\%). Potential effectiveness would depend on reaching target participation rates and finding resources to meet the demand for FOBT and colonoscopy.

Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used as the initiating agent followed by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HCDD) as promoters, Two distinct versions of the stochastic model, called Model I and Model II, were fitted to the data. Model I made the assumption that, after the initial phase of acute initiation with DEN, background rates of initiation were equal in animals treated with DEN and controls that were not so treated. Model II, which fit the data substantially better than Model I, assumed that background rates of initiation were different in DEN-treated animals and animals not so treated, even after the acute phase of initiation was over, Both models indicate that the rates of cell division and apoptosis of altered cells are increased during TCDD treatment, In contrast, the rate of division remains more or less constant during treatment with HCDD, but the rate of apoptosis is decreased. The background rate of initiation during treatment with HCDD is equal to that in controls not administered promoters, With TCDD treatment, however, the rate of initiation estimated from the model is substantially increased over controls. The analysis also suggests that there is heterogeneity within foci of the rates of cell division, with cells on the surface of foci dividing faster than cells in the interior.

SETTING: A large teaching hospital in North London. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients treated at the Royal Free Hospital, London, who had at least one reported CD4+ T-cell count of less than 5 x 10(6)/l and were being followed up for clinical care prior to the date of this cell count. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death. METHODS: Proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty-nine patients were included in the study. The median survival after a very low CD4+ T-cell count was 0.95 years (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-1.19), although 20\% survived for over 2 years. Older age and a previous AIDS diagnosis were related to poorer outcome. A higher CD8+ T-cell count at baseline was also associated with a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: A CD4+ T-cell count of less than 5 x 10(6)/l did not necessarily mean imminent death, with a median survival after this count of just under 1 year. These results will enable clinicians to provide appropriate counselling for patients at this late stage and to plan terminal care},

The mesothelioma rate for US males exhibits an increasing trend throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. The trend has been attributed to occupational exposure in the shipbuilding industry during World War II, in manufacturing, and in building construction. Incidence data (1973-1992) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were used to investigate current trends in age-adjusted and age-specific mesothelioma rates. An age and birth-cohort model was used to project both lifetime probabilities of mesothelioma by cohort and the annual number of cases expected over the next 70 years. The current trend in female rates is flat (age-adjusted rate = 0.30 per 100,000). The estimated lifetime risk for females is 2.5 x 10(-4), independent of birth cohort. The projected average annual number of female cases is 500. For males, the age-adjusted mesothelioma rate is increasing solely due to the age group 75 years and over, albeit at a declining growth rate. Lifetime risk for males peaks at 2 x 10(-3) for the 1925-1929 birth cohort, then decreases to 5 x 10(-4) for the 1955-1959 birth cohort. The pattern of rates reflected in the age and birth-cohort model suggests a peak in the annual number of mesothelioma cases for males at 2,300 before the year 2000. The number of male cases then will drop during the next 50-60 years toward 500. These trends mirror the US trend in raw asbestos consumption and a reduction in workplace airborne asbestos levels.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Anonymous antenatal testing for HIV antibodies suggests that the majority of HIV-positive women in the UK remain undiagnosed. Primary care reaches the majority of the population and women present more often than men. Sexual health matters are frequently raised, so there is an opportunity to discuss concerns with respect to HIV. Women often present with advanced HIV disease and with antiviral treatments proving to be more effective, there is now an even greater incentive to diagnose HIV early. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to look at access to medical care 1 year prior to HIV diagnosis in 100 HIV-positive women and to establish whether a discussion regarding HIV was recalled. METHOD: The setting was an established clinic for HIV-positive women in the Royal Free Hospital, London. In a 6-month period a questionnaire was completed by 100 women with their clinic doctor. RESULTS: Women were young (mean age 31). Most (84\%) were infected by heterosexual sex. Forty-six per cent of the women presented with symptomatic HIV or AIDS and 50\% were black Africans, hence there is a large ethnic bias in this sample. General practice was accessed by 65\% of the women 1 year prior to HIV diagnosis. Few (14\%) women recalled a discussion concerning HIV. Secondary care settings such as gynaecology and general outpatients were also frequently attended, but again HIV was apparently rarely discussed. There was no significant difference when variables such as time since diagnosis, health care setting, or ethnic group were concerned with respect to recall of a discussion concerning HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Despite coming from 'high risk' groups or presenting with symptomatic disease in the year prior to HIV diagnosis, few women recalled discussing HIV in either primary or secondary care settings. As these sites were commonly accessed, we feel that doctors and other health care workers should be encouraged and trained to raise HIV more routinely in their consultations},

This allows incidence estimates to vary flexibly and smoothly in both age and time. We propose generalized cross-validation as a guide for choice of an appropriate level of smoothing and describe an EM algorithm for computing the estimates. We propose the method primarily for qualitative assessment of trends in age-specific incidence over time and apply it to a small Italian data set on men who have sex with men. The analysis suggests a trend over time of increasing relative incidence among younger individuals, consistent with incidence patterns observed in other countries.}

At exposure levels seen in occupational cohorts it is concluded that the exposure specific risk of mesothelioma from the three principal commercial asbestos types is broadly in the ratio 1:100:500 for chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite respectively. For lung cancer the conclusions are less clear cut. Cohorts exposed only to crocidolite or amosite record similar exposure specific risk levels (around 5\% excess lung cancer per f/ml.yr); but chrysotile exposed cohorts show a less consistent picture, with a clear discrepancy between the mortality experience of a cohort of xhrysotile textile workers in Carolina and the Quebec miners cohort. Taking account of the excess risk recorded by cohorts with mixed fibre exposures (generally{\textless}1\%), the Carolina experience looks uptypically high. It is suggested that a best estimate lung cancer risk for chrysotile alone would be 0.1\%, with a highest reasonable estimate of 0.5\%. The risk differential between chrysotile and the two amphibole fibres for lunc cancer is thus between 1:10 and 1:50.Examination of the inter-study dose response relationship for the amphibole fibres suggests a non-linear relationship for all three cancer endpoints (pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas, and lung cancer). The peritoneal mesothelioma risk is proportional to the square of cumulative exposure, lung cancer risk lies between a linear and square relationship and pleural mesothelioma seems to rise less than linearly with cumulative dose. Although these non-linear relationships provide a best fit ot the data, statistical and other uncertainties mean that a linear relationship remains arguable for pleural and lung tumours (but not or peritoneal tumours).Based on these considerations, and a discussion fo the associated uncertainties, a series of quantified risk summary statements for different elvels of cumulative exposure are presented.}

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relative risk of starting treatment regimens and disease progression (new AIDS-defining illness or death). RESULTS: There are 126 women in the SAC (9.0\%). The median CD4 lymphocyte count at first visit among all patients was 350 cells/mm3, and was significantly higher among women than men (428 cells/mm3 versus 345 cells/mm3, respectively; p = 0.0024). Participating women were less well educated than participating men; 29\% of women did not proceed beyond a tenth grade education compared with 13\% of men; only 28\% of women went to college or received a degree in contrast to 40\% of men (p {\textless}. 001). The proportion of women in the cohort has increased over the past 5 years (p {\textless}.001). During a median follow-up period of 35 months that dates back as far as 1985, 572 patients (40.8\%) died or progressed to a new AIDS-defining illness, of whom 30 were women (5. 2\%). In a multivariate Cox model stratified by calendar quartile of first visit and adjusted for latest CD4, AIDS status, age, exposure group, education, and prior treatment, women were significantly less likely to start highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; defined as at least three antiretrovirals taken consecutively; relative hazard [RH], 0.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.98; p =.033), significantly less likely to start a protease inhibitor containing treatment regimen (RH, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.98; p =.040) and significantly less likely to start a HAART regimen including a protease inhibitor (RH, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.48-1.00; p =.049). After adjustment for potentially confounding variables such as CD4 lymphocyte count and treatment regimen, no difference in disease progression was found between men and women (RH, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0. 49-1.19; p =.24). Among patients who started HAART, the CD4 lymphocyte count and viral load at starting treatment regimens was similar between men and women, as were the immunologic and virologic response following initiation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite free access to antiretrovirals, women in the SAC were significantly less likely to start HAART treatment regimens, and the reasons for this need further investigation. Response to treatment was similar between genders. No evidence was found for a poorer long-term clinical outcome in women, but given the proven large clinical benefits of HAART, this may change in the future},

The results were compared with data on 35 HIV-1-seronegative subjects, 18 untreated asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive individuals, and 24 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). Subjects receiving HAART showed a significantly elevated number and percentage of CD38- and HLA-DR-positive and CD28-negative CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as a lower percentage of naive (CD45RA+62L+) CD8+ T lymphocytes compared with HIV-1-uninfected controls. Even subjects with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA showed a persistent elevation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. However, fewer activated CD8+ T lymphocytes were observed in subjects receiving HAART than in untreated individuals and subjects administered RTIs. In individuals receiving RTIs, CD8+ cell activation was not significantly reduced compared with untreated subjects. Of all evaluated activation markers, the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing CD38 and the combination of CD38 and HLA-DR showed the best correlation with plasma HIV-1 RNA. The persistence of CD8+ T lymphocyte activation in subjects receiving HAART strongly suggests ongoing viral activity, even in subjects with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. A complete normalization of immunologic changes of CD8+ T lymphocytes would therefore require a more potent drug regimen or a longer duration of therapy.}

Two reviewers independently abstracted data regarding sensitivity and specificity of PET. RESULTS: 25 studies (15 cervical cancer, 10 ovarian cancer) met inclusion criteria for full text review. For cervical cancer, pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET for aortic node metastasis are 0.84 (95\% CI 0.68-0.94) and 0.95 (0.89-0.98). Pooled sensitivity and specificity for detection of pelvic node metastasis are: PET, 0.79 (0.65-0.90) and 0.99 (0.96-0.99); MRI, 0.72 (0.53-0.87) and 0.96 (0.92-0.98). Pooled sensitivity for CT is 0.47 (0.21-0.73) (pooled specificity not available). Pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET for recurrent cervical cancer with clinical suspicion are 0.96 (0.87-0.99) and 0.81 (0.58-0.94). For ovarian cancer, pooled sensitivity and specificity to detect recurrence with clinical suspicion are: PET, 0.90 (0.82-0.95) and 0.86 (0.67-0.96); conventional imaging, 0.68 (0.49-0.83) and 0.58 (0.33-0.80); CA-125, 0.81 (0.62-0.92) and 0.83 (0.58-0.96). When conventional imaging and CA-125 are negative, pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET are 0.54 (0.39-0.69) and 0.73 (0.56-0.87), respectively. When CA-125 is rising and conventional imaging is negative, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET are 0.96 (0.88-0.99) and 0.80 (0.44-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence that PET is useful for the pre-treatment detection of retroperitoneal nodal metastasis in cervical cancer. There is fair evidence that PET is useful for the detection of recurrent cervical cancer. PET is less useful for the detection of microscopic residual ovarian cancer but has fair sensitivity to detect recurrence in the setting of a rising CA-125 and negative conventional imaging studies. Available studies are limited by low numbers of patients and wide confidence intervals.}

Administration (i.p.) of (+/-)-AR-A008055 60 min after 5 min of global cerebral ischaemia in gerbils produced a dose-dependent protection of the hippocampus from damage. Both enantiomers [(R)-(+)-AR-A008055 and (S)-(-)- AR-A008055] at 600 micromol/kg produced similar protection to that following clomethiazole (600\& micromol/kg) and both produced similar and sustained neuroprotection, at 4, 7 and 21 days post-insult. When infused intravenously over a 2-h period, both enantiomers produced concentration-dependent neuroprotection, with the enantiomers providing similar protection at every plasma concentration (50-200 nmol/ml). The efficacy of (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 was similar to clomethiazole, but it was slightly less potent. Ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux from rat brain cortical prisms in vitro was inhibited by both isomers (100 microM). The inhibitory effect of (R)-(+)-AR-A008055 was blocked by bicuculline (10 microM) and picrotoxin (100 microM), while the effect of (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 was only antagonised by picrotoxin. This indicated that (S)-(-)-AR-A008055, like clomethiazole, is able to open the GABA(A)-chloride channel in the absence of endogenous GABA. (R)-(+)-AR-A008055 was more potent than (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 in enhancing the concentration of GABA in the medium following 30 min exposure of tissue to the ischaemic conditions, suggesting that it is an effective GABA uptake inhibitor. This action may explain both its effect on glutamate efflux in vitro and its neuroprotective effect in vivo.}

Specifically we wanted to define the relative impact on cancer-specific mortality rates of the individual epidemiological components: pathological incidences by age groups, cancer progression rates, and the effect of competing causes of death, assuming expectant management (i.e. no definitive treatment). A biological model of prostate cancer incidence and progression was converted into a standard Markov tree where competing causes of death could occur. Weighted averages of progression rates were obtained from clinical studies. Separate cohorts of 30 year old black and white men were followed for 50 years. The model yielded cancer-specific mortality rates, overall mortality rates, and pathologic prevalences for both white and black males, consistent with the literature. Sensitivity analyses showed that of all the parameters studied, the pathological incidence of cancer in men under 50 years of age had the greatest impact on the cancer-specific mortality rates. Also important was the annual probability of progression of A1 lesions. However the other parameters including pathological incidence in older males, and progression from locally-extensive to metastatic lesions had much smaller effects. In summary, this model correlates the clinical literature with the epidemiology of prostate cancer and can be used for further decision analyses. We recommend that future research be done to more precisely quantify the pathological incidence of prostate cancer in men under 50-60 years of age. More certainty is also needed before generalizing the results of relatively small A1 series to millions of men, since A1 progression rates critically affect the eventual cancer-specific mortality. Enough uncertainty remains at this point however, that we cannot advocate widespread screening for prostate cancer until its merit be demonstrated either by the definitive long term study, or by examination of costs and quality-of-life-adjusted benefits.}

Of the 1128 who had died, 897 had worked before 1969; 34 of the death certificates received for these men mentioned mesothelioma and for another nine asbestosis was reported in the absence of mesothelioma or lung cancer. A statistically significant excess of lung cancer (SMR 136) was found. For the post-1969 workers, one case of asbestosis and one case of mesothelioma were reported, but further investigation of these cases showed probable occupational exposure to asbestos many years before 1969. The time from first exposure for this section of the population is too short to exclude an excess of asbestos related disease. The most noticeable excess of asbestos related disease was seen among the insulation workers who had more than twice (SMR 256) the expected number of deaths from lung cancer, and for whom almost 10\% of all death certificates mentioned mesothelioma. No excess of any alimentary tract cancer was found and the population showed a significant deficit of large bowel cancer mortality (SMR 54).}

Suicide rates for males (all ages and young adults) were significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban areas.

Adjusting for mental disorder prevalence, in addition to migrant status, reduced the excess suicide risk in rural areas; the excess was reduced further with addition of mental health service utilization. The implications of this study are that socioeconomic circumstances in rural populations contribute to higher male suicide rates compared to urban areas, but these conditions may be partly mediated by mental disorder prevalence and mental health service utilization.}

To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and applied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of June 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research Council RE01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been censored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored survival times were imputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in survival times and by drawing a random sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least to the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then examined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE01 trial, median survival of patients treated with interferon was 3.0 months (95\% confidence interval = 0.3 to 5.5 months) longer than that in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed clear separation between treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons of individual observed and imputed survival times between groups of patients showed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest between-group differences than Kaplan-Meier comparisons. These graphs of the distribution of survival times for individuals in each study group, which are simple to produce, may usefully complement Kaplan-Meier plots.},

This paper describes a method of modelling the costs of care for lung cancer. The perspective of the costing model is that of the government as payer in a universal health care system. Clinical algorithms were developed to describe the management of non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) lung cancer. Patients were allocated to the treatment algorithms in the model, based on a knowledge of the stage distribution of cases within provincial cancer registries and an estimate of the use of therapeutic modalities, according to lung cancer experts. A microsimulation model (POHEM) developed at Statistics Canada was used to integrate data on risk factors, disease onset and progression, health care resource utilization and direct medical care costs. The model incorporates survival data on patients, according to cell type and stage, based on published studies. Relapse and terminal care costs were assigned during the year of death, in order to determine the cost of continuing care and the cumulative cost of lung cancer management over time. Patients surviving five years were assumed to be cured. The model estimates that the total five year cost to provide care to the 15,624 cases of lung cancer diagnosed in Canada in 1988 was in excess of \$328 million. Over 82\% of this total was spent in the first year for diagnostic tests, therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combinations of these), hospitalization and follow-up costs. The average five year cost per case was \$21,000, and ranged from a high of \$29,860 for limited disease SCLC, to a low of \$16,500 for Stage IV NSCLC. The actual cost of providing care, including the management of complications, is unknown and our estimates should be regarded as an idealized estimate of the cost of lung cancer management. However, the POHEM model has a level of sophistication which, we believe, reasonably reflects the cost per case and total costs of treating lung cancer by stage and therapeutic modality in Canada.}

The study population comprised males living in Stockholm County in 2011 (n=1034129), of which 229 872 had a PSA test during the period 2003-2011.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We determined limited-duration-point prevalence of PSA testing and performed survival analysis on PSA retesting for men aged 40-89 yr.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The number of PSA tests increased from 54239 in 2003 to 124613 in 2011. During the 9-yr study period, 46\%, 68\%, and 77\% of men without a prior prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and aged 50-59 yr, 60-69 yr, and 70-79 yr, respectively, had a PSA test. During 2010 and 2011, 25\%, 40\%, and 46\% of men aged 50-59 yr, 60-69 yr, and 70-79 yr, respectively, had a PSA test. The prevalence of PSA testing increased from 2003 to 2011. The probability of retesting was PSA and age dependent, with a 26-mo cumulative incidence of 0.337 (95\% confidence interval, 0.333-0.341) if the first PSA value was {\textless}1 ng/ml. The main limitations were (1) that PSA data prior to 2003 were not available and (2) that the study cohort was restricted to men who were alive in 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: Although screening for PCa is not recommended in Sweden, PSA testing in Stockholm County was high across ages ranging from 40 to 89 yr and increased during the period 2003-2011. The probability of PSA retesting was high, regardless of the original PSA level. These results contrast with current clinical recommendations and raise calls for a change, either through structured PCa testing or more detailed guidelines on PSA testing.},

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1572 women with a community-based LSIL interpretation were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy, triage based on enrollment HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology at a colposcopy referral threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or conservative management based on repeat cytology at a referral threshold of HSIL. All arms included 2 years of semiannual follow-up and colposcopy at exit. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was offered to women with histologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 at any visit or persistent CIN grade 1 at exit. The main study end point was 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3. RESULTS: The 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3 was approximately 15\% in all study arms. The HPV triage arm was closed early because more than 80\% of women were HPV positive, precluding efficient triage. The immediate colposcopy strategy yielded 55.9\% sensitivity for cumulative cases of CIN grade 3 diagnosed over 2 years. A conservative management strategy of repeat cytology at the HSIL threshold referred 18.8\% of women while detecting 48.4\% of cumulative CIN grade 3. At lower cytology thresholds, sensitivity would improve but would ultimately yield unacceptably high referral rates. CONCLUSION: LSIL cytology is best managed by colposcopy initially, because there was no useful triage strategy identified. Management of these patients, after colposcopy to rule out immediately overt CIN grade 2 or 3, needs to be determined.}

The vital status of 73\% of the men and 58\% of the women employed in the industry was known at 31 December 1980, providing 95 264 person-years of follow up with 820 deaths in men and 4914 person-years with 23 deaths in women. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes in men was 1.53 (95\% confidence interval 1.43 to 1.64). Statistically significant excess death rates were observed in men for neoplasms, particularly malignant mesothelioma (32 deaths), neoplasms of the trachea, bronchus, and lung (SMR 2.64), and neoplasms of the stomach (SMR 1.90); respiratory diseases, particularly pneumoconiosis (SMR 25.5); infections, particularly tuberculosis (SMR 4.09); mental disorders particularly alcoholism (SMR 4.87); digestive diseases, particularly peptic ulceration (SMR 2.46) and cirrhosis of the liver (SMR 3.94); and injuries and poisonings, particularly non-transport accidents (SMR 2.36). The excess mortality from pneumoconiosis, malignant mesothelioma, and respiratory cancers, but not stomach neoplasms, was dependent on time since first exposure and cumulative exposure. There was no increase in mortality from laryngeal cancer (SMR 1.09) or neoplasms other than those listed. The SMR for all causes in women was 1.47 (95\% confidence interval 0.98-2.21) and for neoplasms 1.99; there was one death from malignant pleural mesothelioma.}

Age-standardized incidence and death rates among men in a variety of countries worldwide were obtained from various sources, survival rates from European sources and elsewhere, and prevalence estimates from the EUROPREVAL study. Results from many published studies were summarized. The incidence of prostate cancer varies widely around the world, with by far the highest rates in the USA and Canada. There has been a gradual increase in the incidence of prostate cancer since the 1960s in many countries and in most continents; there were large increases in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the USA, but increases have also occurred in countries with comparatively low incidence, e.g. India. Survival from prostate cancer improved during the 1970s and 1980s; further increases in the 1990s may be largely a result of earlier diagnosis. There were wide differences in survival across Europe, with rates in the UK well below the average, but all European rates were far below those in the USA. There was wide variation in the prevalence of prostate cancer in Europe; in some countries with high incidence and high life-expectancy, prostate cancers formed approximately 15\% of all prevalent cancers in men. Mortality from prostate cancer has also increased in many countries, but to a lesser extent than incidence; this is consistent with the observed trends in survival. Mortality decreased slightly in the mid to late 1990s in several countries, including the USA, Canada, England, France and Austria. Part of the apparent increases in the incidence of prostate cancer has been associated with diagnostic artefacts (particularly detecting preclinical tumours through the increased use of transurethral resection) which may also have had an effect on death certification through the incorrect attribution of prostate cancer as the underlying cause of death. However, the greatest effect on the registration of new cases of prostate cancer has been the increased availability of prostate specific antigen testing during the early- to mid-1990s. Possibly, in addition to the effect of attribution bias, the earlier diagnosis of prostate cancers has contributed to the recent slight decreases in mortality. However, this is unlikely to account for much of the reduction, given the slow development of the disease from onset to death. Changes in disease management are probably more important. There are many strong arguments against introducing population-based screening for prostate cancer.}

The more traditional displays such as line charts are compared to approaches based on smoothing and two- and three-dimensional plots which have recently been proposed. Other graphical techniques which are principally concerned with displaying interactions, such as biplots and correspondence analysis, are also considered. These techniques are illustrated with examples to compare the techniques revealing their strengths and weaknesses.

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study in a teaching and referral hospital involving all consecutive patients who were prescribed a nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen between September 1997 and May 2000. METHOD: Cutaneous and hepatic adverse reactions and clinical hepatitis were assessed. Blood analysis including plasma HIV-1 RNA CD4 cell counts, liver chemistry tests, and serology for hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatotoxicity was defined as an increase of at least threefold in serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with baseline values. RESULTS: Of a total of 610 patients, 82 (13.4\%) were antiretroviral naive when commencing nevirapine, and 46.2 and 8.9\% were coinfected with hepatitis C and B viruses, respectively. Median duration of exposure to nevirapine was 8.7 months (interquartile range 3.4--14.3). Hepatotoxicity developed in 76 (12.5\%), an incidence of 13.1/100 person-years. Kaplan--Meier estimated incidence of hepatotoxicity at 3, 6 and 12 months was 3.7, 9.7 and 20.1\%, respectively. In seven (1.1\%) patients, hepatotoxicity was associated with clinical hepatitis, which was reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Multivariate analysis identified the duration of prior exposure to antiretroviral drugs, hepatitis C virus, and higher baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase as independent risk factors for hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatotoxicity but not clinical hepatitis was common in HIV-1-infected patients receiving nevirapine-containing regimens and the incidence steadily increased over time. Prolonged exposure to any antiretroviral therapy, coinfection with hepatitis C virus and abnormal baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase identified patients at a higher risk},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS   Practice-based, retrospective data on PSA testing patterns in 2007 were collected from a random sample of 87 general practices using EMIS LV computer systems within the passively observed non-intervention arm of a cluster-randomized controlled trial.   Information for a total of 126 716 men aged 45-89 years with no recorded diagnosis of prostate cancer prior to 1 January 2007 was collected.   RESULTS   In all, 7902 (6.2\%) of 126 716 men aged 45-89 without a prior diagnosis of prostate cancer underwent at least one PSA test from their general practitioner during 2007 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-7.0\%; practice-based inter-quartile range 3.6-8.4\%].   PSA testing rates were 1.4\% (95\% CI 1.1-1.6\%) in men aged 45-49, rising to 11.3\% (95\% CI 10.0-12.9\%) at age 75-79 years (P for trend {\textless}0.001).   Testing rates were lowest in the three northern centres (3.5-5.7\%) vs the three more southern centres (7.1-8.9\%; P {\textless} 0.001).   For every 20 points increase in the index of multiple deprivation score, the proportion of men tested fell by 1.7\% (95\% CI -2.5 to -0.8\%; P {\textless} 0.001).   Lower proportions of men were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer in practices testing more men (odds ratio for a one unit increase in the natural log of testing 0.76; 95\% CI 0.60-0.97; P = 0.025).   CONCLUSION   Overall levels of PSA testing in UK general practice remain low, but for those tested there are important variations by age, deprivation and geographical location that do not appear to reflect clinical need or the intention of current policy.   PSA testing in general practice is currently skewed towards older men, and current policy enabling all men to make an informed choice about PSA testing is not being effectively implemented as uptake clearly varies by socioeconomic status.   This reinforces the need for robust evidence regarding the costs and benefits of using the PSA test for the detection of localized prostate cancer in the UK, a full assessment of the health economic implications and a revision of the current policy.},

The hazard or incidence function of cancer is expressed in terms of the Probability Generating Function (PGF) of the number of normal and mutated cells at birth. Using Filtered Poisson Process Theory, we obtain the PGF for several models for the accumulation of gestational mutations. In particular, we develop expressions for the hazard function when one or two successive mutations could occur during gestation. We also calculate the hazard when the background gestational mutation rates are increased due to exposure to mutagens, such as prenatal radiation. To illustrate the use of our models, we apply them to colorectal cancer in the SEER database. We find that the proportion of cancer risk attributable to developmental mutations depends on age and that it could be quite significant when gestational mutation rates are high. The analysis of the SEER data also shows that gestational mutations could contribute to inter-individual variations in colorectal cancer risk.},

Information sought on each case included evidence of whether the infection had been newly acquired, defined by the diagnosis of HIV seroconversion illness or by the report of a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result occurring within the 12 months prior to diagnosis of infection. RESULTS. Of 3602 reported cases of HIV infection in adults and adolescents newly diagnosed in Australia between 1991 and 1993, 11.4\% were identified as newly acquired. The majority (85\%) of cases of newly diagnosed HIV infection occurred among men who reported homosexual contact, and 15\% of these cases were identified as newly acquired. Average age at diagnosis was 31 years for cases of newly acquired infection and 34 years for other cases. CONCLUSIONS. Surveillance for newly acquired HIV infection has been established at a national level in Australia and provides valuable information for planning primary HIV prevention programs},

Data from the Campinas Population-Based Cancer Registry (RCBP) related to gastric cancer cases diagnosed from 1991 to 1994 were analyzed. Observed and relative survival rates were calculated, and to compare rates between different groups and international populations, the relative mortality risk was used. One-year relative survival rate for patients with gastric cancer was 33\%, and five-year relative survival was 9\%, confirming the poor prognosis of gastric cancer. Gender had no influence on survival, while the prognosis was better for young people. There was a gradient of severity from the localized to the metastatic state, not statistically significant. The group with undifferentiated adenocarcinomas had longer survival, with 47\% of patients alive after the first year, whereas only 7\% of those without a histological classification survived the first year after diagnosis. Compared with international results like the pool of European registries, the risk was greater, especially considering the five-year survival rates.}

METHODS: We determined the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia among 938,576 women younger than 65 years of age, stratified according to the number of previous consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests. Using a Markov model that estimates the rate at which dysplasia will progress to cancer, we estimated the risk of cancer within three years after one or more negative Papanicolaou tests, as well as the number of additional Papanicolaou tests and colposcopic examinations that would be required to avert one case of cancer given a particular interval between screenings. RESULTS: Among 31,728 women 30 to 64 years of age who had had three or more consecutive negative tests, the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 was 0.028 percent and the prevalence of grade 3 neoplasia was 0.019 percent; none of the women had invasive cervical cancer. According to our model, the estimated risk of cancer with annual Papanicolaou tests for three years was 2 in 100,000 among women 30 to 44 years of age, 1 in 100,000 among women 45 to 59 years of age, and 1 in 100,000 among women 60 to 64 years of age; these risks would be 5 in 100,000, 2 in 100,000, and 1 in 100,000, respectively, if screening were performed once three years after the last negative test. To avert one additional case of cancer by screening 100,000 women annually for three years rather than once three years after the last negative test, an average of 69,665 additional Papanicolaou tests and 3861 colposcopic examinations would be needed in women 30 to 44 years of age and an average of 209,324 additional Papanicolaou tests and 11,502 colposcopic examinations in women 45 to 59 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with annual screening for three years, screening performed once three years after the last negative test in women 30 to 64 years of age who have had three or more consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests is associated with an average excess risk of cervical cancer of approximately 3 in 100,000.}

Meta-analysis may be particularly useful to formally examine sources of heterogeneity, to clarify the relationship between environmental exposures and health effects, and to generate information beyond that provided by individual studies or a narrative review. However, meta-analysis may not be useful when the relationship between exposure and disease is obvious, when there are only a few studies of the key health outcomes, or when there is substantial confounding or other biases which cannot be adjusted for in the analysis. Recent increases in the use of meta-analysis in environmental epidemiology have highlighted the need for guidelines for the application of the technique. Guidelines, in the form of desirable and undesirable attributes, are presented in this paper for various components of a meta-analysis including study identification and selection; data extraction and analysis; and interpretation, presentation, and communication of results. Also discussed are the appropriateness of the use of meta-analysis in environmental health studies and when meta-analysis should or should not be used.}

	annote = {When investigating variables thought to be of potential importance to AIDS pathogenesis, it is common practice to initially carry out a cross-sectional study comparing those with symptomatic disease/low CD4 counts with those with no symptoms/high CD4 counts. While it is widely appreciated that such studies have weaknesses compared with those involving patient follow-up, the particular biases likely to arise in the context of HIV infection have not been formally evaluated. In an attempt to do this, data on HIV progression for 50,000 notional patients who became infected in the years between 1976 (assumed to be the start of the epidemic) and 2010 were simulated under various scenarios. In Scenario 1, we considered a variable called X, which was specified to be associated with more rapid progression of HIV infection. In Scenario 2, we considered a variable Y, which was specified not to be associated with more rapid progression but which tended to change in value as a result of HIV-induced immunosuppression. Variable Z, in Scenario 3, was specified to be associated with more rapid progression and to change in value when severe immunosuppression developed. Cross-sectional analyses evaluating the association between variables X, Y, and Z and the CD4 count/presence of AIDS were performed for data as of 1980, 1985, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to assess the extent to which the true role of the three variables could be ascertained. For Scenario 1, cross-sectional analyses performed on these data later in the epidemic falsely suggested that variable X was not related to HIV progression. Variable Y in Scenario 2 falsely appeared to be related to HIV progression, due to the inability of the cross-sectional design to distinguish the fact that changes in variable Y were as a result of immunosuppression and not a possible cause of it. In Scenario 3, variable Z showed a relationship with the presence of AIDS for which the typical interpretation would lead to the suggestion that its effect is in the reverse direction to that which was, in fact, the case. In conclusion, as the HIV epidemic progresses, cross-sectional studies will increasingly tend to give misleading results. Most importantly, it is incorrect to conclude that variables found to have no association with HIV disease stage in such studies are not of potential importance to pathogenesis}

METHODS: We developed a computer simulation model by use of information on population-based PSA testing patterns, cancer detection rates, average lead time (the time by which diagnosis is advanced by screening), and projected decreased risk of death associated with early diagnosis of prostate cancer through PSA testing. The model provides estimates of the number of deaths prevented by PSA testing for the 7-year period from 1988 through 1994 and projects what prostate cancer mortality for these years would have been in the absence of PSA testing. RESULTS: Results were generated by assuming a level of screening efficacy similar to that hypothesized for the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Under this assumption, the projected mortality in the absence of PSA testing continued the increasing trend observed before 1991 only when it was assumed that the mean lead time was 3 years or less. Projected mortality trends in the absence of PSA screening were not consistent with pre-1991 increasing trends for lead times of 5 years and 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: When screening is assumed to be at least as efficacious as hypothesized in the PLCO trial, it is unlikely that the entire decline in prostate cancer mortality can be explained by PSA testing based on current beliefs concerning lead time. Only very short lead times would produce a decline in mortality of the magnitude that has been observed.}

Nonetheless, it is a large-sample method that can exhibit considerable bias when certain types of matched sets are infrequent or when the model contains too many parameters. Sparse-data bias can cause misleading inferences about confounding, effect modification, dose response, and induction periods, and can interact with other biases. In this paper, the authors describe these problems in the context of matched case-control analysis and provide examples from a study of electrical wiring and childhood leukemia and a study of diet and glioma. The same problems can arise in any likelihood-based analysis, including ordinary logistic regression. The problems can be detected by careful inspection of data and by examining the sensitivity of estimates to category boundaries, variables in the model, and transformations of those variables. One can also apply various bias corrections or turn to methods less sensitive to sparse data than conditional likelihood, such as Bayesian and empirical-Bayes (hierarchical regression) methods.}

The age-specific incidence rate of HPV, and regression and progression rates of HPV and squamous intraepithelial lesions, were obtained from the literature. The effects of varying natural history parameters on cervical cancer incidence were evaluated by using sensitivity analysis. The base-case model resulted in a lifetime cervical cancer risk of 3.67\% and a lifetime cervical cancer mortality risk of 1.26\%, with a peak incidence of 81/100,000 at age 50 years. Age-specific distributions of precursors were similar to reported data. Lifetime risk of cancer was most sensitive to the incidence of HPV and the probability of rapid HPV progression to high-grade lesions (two- to threefold variations in risk). The model approximates the age-specific incidence of cervical cancer and provides a tool for evaluating the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer carcinogenesis as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention strategies.}

At the time of examination, a single blood specimen was obtained, and the serum was frozen. After a surveillance period of more than 20 years, 142 tissue-confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer were identified. Their stored sera and those of 142 matched controls were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography for the following: total carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, total retinoids, retinol, total tocopherols, alpha-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and gamma-tocopherol. Odds ratios for prostate cancer, based on quartiles of serum micronutrient levels, were determined using conditional logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio for the highest quartiles were 1.8 (95\% confidence interval, 0.9-3.9) for beta-cryptoxanthin, 1.6 (0.8-3.5) for beta-carotene, 0.8 (0.4-1.5) for retinol, and 0.7 (0.3-1.5) for gamma-tocopherol, but none of the differences was statistically significant. For the other micronutrients, the results were also unremarkable. The findings of this study indicate that none of the micronutrients is strongly associated with prostate cancer risk.}

The partial least squares (PLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methodologies are used for this purpose where we first modify the data to account for censoring. Three approaches of handling right censored data-reweighting, mean imputation, and multiple imputation-are considered. Their performances are examined in a detailed simulation study and compared with that of full data PLS and LASSO had there been no censoring. A major objective of this article is to investigate the performances of PLS and LASSO in the context of microarray data where the number of covariates is very large and there are extremely few samples. We demonstrate that LASSO outperforms PLS in terms of prediction error when the list of covariates includes a moderate to large percentage of useless or noise variables; otherwise, PLS may outperform LASSO. For a moderate sample size (100 with 10,000 covariates), LASSO performed better than a no covariate model (or noise-based prediction). The mean imputation method appears to best track the performance of the full data PLS or LASSO. The mean imputation scheme is used on an existing data set on lung cancer. This reanalysis using the mean imputed PLS and LASSO identifies a number of genes that were known to be related to cancer or tumor activities from previous studies.},

We estimated the long-term effects of finasteride on PSA in men with and without a prostate cancer diagnosis at the end of the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed serial PSA in participants in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who had an end of study biopsy (928 with cancer and 8,620 with negative biopsy) or an interim diagnosis of prostate cancer (671). Linear mixed effects regression models were fit to longitudinal PSA values beginning 1 year after randomization. RESULTS: In subjects with no cancer in the end of study biopsy PSA in the finasteride arm showed a median annual decrease of 2\% [corrected] after year 1, while PSA in the control arm showed an annual increase of 3\% (p {\textless}0.001). In end of study cases PSA increased annually by 6\% (placebo) and 7\% (finasteride). In those with interim diagnoses PSA increased by 11\% (placebo) and 15\% (finasteride) each year prior to diagnosis. Cases with high grade disease (Gleason 7 and above) had greater PSA increases than cases with low grade disease (p {\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In men who have been receiving finasteride for more than 1 year time varying adjustment factors may be needed to determine whether PSA is in the normal range. In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial cohort the adjustment factor required to preserve median PSA increased from 2 at 24 months to 2.5 at 7 years after the initiation of finasteride.}

An extreme difference in the expected frequency of mesothelioma among previously severely asbestos-dust-exposed persons and the rest of the population is characteristic. Accordingly, death from mesothelioma does not only show a predominantly high occupational asbestos-dust-risk association but also to environmental exposition by neighborhood and household contact. Thus in production and use of asbestos-containing products a risk must be expected. Due to the great likelihood of asbestos-induced mesothelioma in the individual case it is justified to consider this tumour as signal for asbestos exposition decades ago. In the German Federal Republic "pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma caused by asbestos" is a notifiable occupational disease since 1977. Each diagnosis of mesothelioma initiates the suspicion and thus the medical duty of notification of an occupational disease. Following the large increase of asbestos consumption in the GFR over the last 30 years an increase of medically confirmed mesotheliomas can be expected.}

It is possible that antiretroviral treatment given early during primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may reduce acute symptoms, help preserve immune function, and improve the long-term prognosis. METHODS. To assess the effect of early antiviral treatment, we conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 77 patients with primary HIV infection were randomly assigned to receive either zidovudine (250 mg twice daily; n = 39) or placebo (n = 38) for six months. RESULTS. The mean time from the onset of symptoms until enrollment in the study was 25.1 days. Among the 43 patients who were still symptomatic at the time of enrollment, there was no appreciable difference in the mean (+/- SE) duration of the retroviral syndrome between the zidovudine group (15.0 +/- 4.1 days) and the placebo group (15.8 +/- 3.6 days). During a mean follow-up period of 15 months, minor opportunistic infections developed in eight patients: oral candidiasis in four, herpes zoster in two, and oral hairy leukoplakia in two. Disease progression was significantly less frequent in the zidovudine group (one opportunistic infection) than in the placebo group (seven opportunistic infections; P = 0.009 by the log-rank test). After adjustment for the base-line CD4 cell count, the patients treated with zidovudine had an average gain of 8.9 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter per month (95 percent confidence interval, -1.4 to 19.1) during the first six months of the study, whereas those receiving placebo had an average loss of 12.0 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter per month (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 18.7), for a between-group difference of 20.9 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter per month (95 percent confidence interval, 8.5 to 33.2; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Antiretroviral therapy administered during primary HIV infection may improve the subsequent clinical course and increase the CD4 cell count.}

The prior model assumes that geographical regions can be combined in clusters with constant relative risk within a cluster. The number of clusters, the location of the clusters, and the risk within each cluster is unknown. This specification can be seen as a change-point problem of variable dimension in irregular, discrete space. We illustrate our method through an analysis of oral cavity cancer mortality rates in Germany and compare the results with those obtained by the commonly used Bayesian disease mapping method of Besag, York, and Mollie (1991, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 43, 1-59).}

New to this analysis is the parameterization of the model such that cell killing by the alpha particles could be included. The model contains parameters characterizing the rate of the first mutation, the net proliferation rate of initiated cells, the ratio of the rates of cell loss (cell killing plus differentiation) and cell division, and the lag time between the appearance of the first malignant cell and the tumor. Data analysis was by standard maximum likelihood estimation techniques. Results indicate that the rate of the first mutation is dependent on radon and consistent with in vitro rates measured experimentally, and that the rate of the second mutation is not dependent on radon. An initial sharp rise in the net proliferation rate of initiated cells was found with increasing exposure rate (denoted model I), which leads to an unrealistically high cell-killing coefficient. A second model (model II) was studied, in which the initial rise was attributed to promotion via a step function, implying that it is due not to radon but to the uranium ore dust. This model resulted in values for the cell-killing coefficient consistent with those found for in vitro cells. An ''inverse dose-rate'' effect is seen, i.e. an increase in the lifetime probability of tumor with a decrease in exposure rate. This is attributed in large part to promotion of intermediate lesions. Since model II is preferable on biological grounds (it yields a plausible cell-killing coefficient), such an effect would not be seen in the absence of an irritant such as uranium ore dust. This analysis presents evidence that a two-stage model describes the data adequately and generates hypotheses regarding the mechanism of radon-induced carcinogenesis.

We consider two statistics (with and without the logarithmic transformation) for testing the equality of two Poisson rates. Two methods for implementing these statistics are reviewed. They are (1) the sample-based method, and (2) the constrained maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the performance of different statistics and methods. Generally, we find that the CMLE method works satisfactorily only for the statistic without the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(2)) while sample-based method performs better for the statistic using the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(3)). It is noteworthy that both statistics perform well for moderate to large Poisson rates (e.g. {\textgreater} or =10). For small Poisson rates (e.g. {\textless}10), W(2) can be liberal (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level {\textgreater} or =1.2) while W(3) can be conservative (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level {\textless} or =0.8). The corresponding sample size formulae are provided and valid in the sense that the simulated powers associated with the approximate sample size formulae are generally close to the pre-chosen power level. We illustrate our methodologies with a real example from a breast cancer study.},

Studies of prostate carcinoma using comparative genomic hybridization and cDNA microarray analysis indicate that numerous biochemical processes may be affected during cellular transformation and progression to an invasive phenotype. Among the consistently observed tumor-associated changes are alterations in fatty acid metabolism that influence diverse cellular activities such as signaling, energy utilization, and membrane fluidity. Increases in fatty acid synthase (FAS) levels have been shown to be one of the earliest and most frequent molecular alterations in prostate carcinogenesis. We sought to identify tumor-associated changes in the expression of genes with functional roles associated with lipid metabolism. Defined populations of normal and neoplastic prostate epithelium were acquired by laser capture microdissection and transcript levels were measured by cDNA microarray hybridization. We determined that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) transcripts were downregulated in cancer relative to normal epithelium. These results were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Further analysis by immunohistochemical evaluation of radical prostatectomy samples employed a quantitative scoring system with a range of 0-300. The median SCD expression levels were 150, 45 and 10 for normal, PIN and carcinoma samples, respectively. Statistically significant differential SCD expression between normal and cancerous epithelium was determined at the p=0.001 level, and between PIN and prostate carcinoma at the p=0.03 level. Of these cases, 92\% overexpressed fatty acid synthase (FAS) in cancerous cells and 84.7\% exhibited the signature of FAS overexpression and SCD loss in prostate carcinoma as compared to normal prostate epithelium. These results indicate that loss of SCD expression is a frequent event in prostate adenocarcinoma, and further supports a role for altered lipid metabolism as a factor in the process of carcinogenesis.}

Knowledge of the temporal distribution of risk factors on the same variables makes it possible to model the relationship between disease and risk factor. The results of such analyses might be difficult to interpret since they are based on aggregated data. But the availability of these data sources should encourage further exploration of its possibilities and limitations. METHODS: The temporal pattern of smoking habits in 5-year birth cohorts from 1890-1949 was established, with data on the proportions of current smokers, former smokers and non-smokers and estimated average daily consumption of tobacco and average duration of smoking. The lung cancer incidence among the cohorts in 1953-1992 was analysed by a model which included an additive excess risk for smokers that depended on daily dose and duration of smoking. RESULTS: The lung cancer incidence in later decades was adequately described by the model, which showed a simple relationship with smoking behaviour in the cohorts. For both current smokers and former smokers, the excess risk was about proportional to the daily amount smoked and the 4.5 power of duration of smoking. The age-specific rates for non-smokers were close to a fifth-power curve of age. CONCLUSIONS: Even if lung cancer incidence is not determined separately for groups with known smoking habits, plausible estimates of the effect of smoking can be derived if appropriate information is available on temporal smoking habits in the population.}

In the analysis of experiments where gene expression is obtained over the life cycle, it is of interest to relate temporal patterns of gene expression associated with different developmental stages to each other to study patterns of long-term developmental gene regulation. We use tools from functional data analysis to study dynamic changes by relating temporal gene expression profiles of different developmental stages to each other. RESULTS: We demonstrate that functional regression methodology can pinpoint relationships that exist between temporary gene expression profiles for different life cycle phases and incorporates dimension reduction as needed for these high-dimensional data. By applying these tools, gene expression profiles for pupa and adult phases are found to be strongly related to the profiles of the same genes obtained during the embryo phase. Moreover, one can distinguish between gene groups that exhibit relationships with positive and others with negative associations between later life and embryonal expression profiles. Specifically, we find a positive relationship in expression for muscle development related genes, and a negative relationship for strictly maternal genes for Drosophila, using temporal gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: Our findings point to specific reactivation patterns of gene expression during the Drosophila life cycle which differ in characteristic ways between various gene groups. Functional regression emerges as a useful tool for relating gene expression patterns from different developmental stages, and avoids the problems with large numbers of parameters and multiple testing that affect alternative approaches.},

The reason may be that since in most cases models have not been validated in independent data, they lack generality and/or credibility. In this paper we consider the situation in which several compatible, independent data sets relating to a given disease with a time-to-event endpoint are available for analysis. The aim is to construct and evaluate a single prognostic model. Building a multivariable model from the available prognostic factors is accomplished within the Cox proportional hazards framework, stratifying by study. Non-linear relationships with continuous predictors are modelled by using fractional polynomials. To assess the discrimination or separation of a survival model, we use the D statistic of Royston and Sauerbrei. D may be interpreted as the separation (log hazard ratio) between the survival distributions for two independent prognostic groups. To evaluate the generality of a prognostic model across the data sets, we propose 'internal-external cross-validation' on D: each study is omitted in turn, the model parameters are estimated from the remaining studies and D is evaluated in the omitted study. Because the linear predictor of a survival model tells only part of the story, we also suggest a method for investigating heterogeneity in the baseline distribution function across studies which involves fitting completely specified, flexible parametric survival models (Royston and Parmar). Our final models combine the prognostic index (obtained with stratification by study) with the pooled baseline survival distribution (estimated parametrically). By applying this methodology, we construct two prognostic scores in superficial bladder cancer. The simpler of the two scores is more suited to clinical application. We show that a three-group prognostic classification scheme based on either score produces well-separated survival curves for each of the data sets, despite identifiable heterogeneity among the baseline distribution functions and to a lesser extent among the prognostic indexes for the individual studies.},

These examples illustrate that a unique answer to the issue of adjustment for SES in occupational cancer studies is not possible, as in some circumstances the adjustment introduces bias, in some it is appropriate and in others both the adjusted and the crude estimates are biased.

The method is demonstrated for colorectal cancer. METHODS: Data on Medicare payments were obtained for colorectal cancer patients for the years 1990 to 1994 from the SEER-Medicare linked database. Claims payment data for control subjects were obtained for Medicare enrollees without cancer residing in the same areas as patients. Estimates of long-term cost ({\textless} or = 25 years following the date of diagnosis) were obtained by combining treatment/phase-specific cost estimates with estimates of long-term survival from SEER. Treatment phases were defined as initial care, terminal care, and continuing care. Cancer-related estimates for each phase were obtained by subtracting costs for control subjects from the observed costs for cancer patients, matching on age group, gender, and registry area. Estimates of long-term cost {\textless} or = 11 years obtained by this method were compared with 11-year estimates obtained by application of the Kaplan-Meier sample average (KMSA) method. RESULTS: The mean initial-phase cancer-related cost was approximately \$18,000 but was higher among patients with more advanced cancer. The mean continuing-phase cancer-related cost was \$1,500 per year and declined with increasing age, but was higher on an annual basis among persons with later stages of cancer and shorter survival time. The mean terminal-phase cancer-related cost was \$15,000 and declined with both age at death and more advanced stage at diagnosis. After the phase-specific estimates were combined, the average long-term cancer-related cost was \$33,700 (\$31,300 at 3\% discount rate) for colon cancer compared with \$36,500 (\$33,800 at 3\% discount rate) for cancer of the rectum. This represented about half of the total long-term cost for Medicare enrollees diagnosed with this disease. Long-term cost was highest for Stage III cancer and lowest for in situ cancer. Eleven-year cancer-related costs estimated by the KMSA method were similar to estimates using the phase-based approach. CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates that valid estimates of cancer-related long-term cost can be obtained from administrative claims data linked to incidence cancer registry data.}

GOAL: The goal of this study was to assess a novel compliance documentation approach. STUDY: After each dose of intravaginal or oral metronidazole, 71 subjects recorded the time on a paper diary and answered questions on a PDA. All PDA entries were unknowingly time-date-stamped. Subjects returned for 2- and 6-week posttreatment examinations. Compliance was calculated using a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Mean patient compliance rates within the oral metronidazole group were greater with the paper diary compared with the PDA (68.3\% and 50.0\%, respectively, P = 0.001). The observed rate of compliance agreement for PDA versus paper diary was 69.0\% (kappa = 0.4). The majority of noncompliant subjects reported they were compliant with the PDA and paper diary. CONCLUSIONS: PDAs could more accurately document true compliance rates and could be reasonable instruments to assess compliance in intravaginal antimicrobial drug or contraceptive trials.}

There was no association between the number of asbestos bodies and time since exposure to asbestos ceased. In subjects without known exposure to asbestos, there was a weak but nonsignificant increase in number of asbestos bodies with increasing age, with 26\% of cases having no asbestos bodies present. It is concluded that the relatively simple technique of light microscopy for counting of asbestos bodies in lung tissue provides a reliable indication of the level of past occupational exposure to crocidolite in subjects whose exposure has been only to crocidolite. This could be extremely useful in follow-up studies of cohorts that lack reliable measures of airborne exposure to crocidolite asbestos.}

To address this issue, the National Cancer Institute initiated the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS). ALTS is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate 3 alternative methods of management, namely, immediate colposcopy, cytologic follow-up, and triage by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. This article summarizes the major findings of ALTS that have been published to date. Patients with ASCUS (n = 3488) or LSIL (n = 1572) were randomly assigned to research arms between November 1996 and December 1998, and were monitored for 2 years. The disease outcome was histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/cancer. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV was too high to permit effective triage of LSIL using HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture 2. However, for the women referred with a cytologic interpretation of ASCUS, HPV triage proved useful, with sensitivity equivalent to immediate colposcopy and a halving of colposcopic referrals. Among older women with ASCUS, HPV testing remained sensitive for detecting CIN 3 and cancer, but the referral percentage was dramatically lower compared to younger women. ALTS yielded insight into the performance of cytology and histopathology; experienced pathologists differed significantly in their interpretations of cervical abnormalities, especially histologic CIN 1 and cytologic ASCUS. Nonetheless, it was possible to distinguish a relatively uncommon type of ASCUS, equivocal for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, that has a high positive predictive value for identifying women with underlying high-grade CIN. Many additional analyses are underway.}

Based on these 18 AIDS cases, it was estimated that to the end of 1994 there were between 35 and 57 children born in Australia and infected with HIV perinatally, with a preferred estimate of 43 children. Assuming that the transmission rate of HIV from infected mothers to their babies was in the range 15 to 35\%, it was estimated that the prevalence of HIV infection among women giving birth in Australia had increased from 0.03 per 1000 (range 0.02-0.07 per 1000) in 1983-1985 to 0.09 per 1000 (range 0.05-0.20 per 1000) in 1992-1994. This range for the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women in 1992-1994 was consistent with estimates of the prevalence from screening studies, and suggests that the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women in Australia remains low},

METHODS: Viremia, cell-associated HIV-1 RNA and DNA in blood and lymph node mononuclear cells were measured using ultrasensitive assays. RESULTS: Viremia decreased rapidly in all patients; HIV RNA remained {\textless} 3 copies/ml in nine patients and fluctuated between 3 and 50 copies/ml in five patients and between 50 and 200 copies/ml in one patient. Decay rates of cell-associated RNA and DNA presented an inflexion point at 1 and 3 months, respectively: first-phase mean half-lives were 0.15 and 0.84 months, respectively, and second-phase mean half-lives were 13.7 and 6.6 months, respectively (95\% confidence interval 4.4-13.8). The second phase decay rates were markedly slower, with a DNA decay rate that was highly associated with the mean levels of cell-associated RNA measured in blood from 6 to 33 months (P= 0.001) and in lymph nodes collected at 14 months (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The clearance of HIV-1 infected cells is correlated with the extent of viral replication as measured by cell-associated RNA levels in both blood and lymph nodes. Quantification of cell-associated RNA and DNA further defines treatment efficacy in 'aviremic' patients.}

Recombinant HIV-vaccinia viruses were used to express HIV antigens in B-cell lines established from subjects seropositive for HIV and seronegative controls. Circulating lymphocytes capable of killing HIV env-expressing autologous B cells were detected in eight of eight seropositive subjects; in addition, at least three seropositive subjects demonstrated gag-specific cytotoxic responses. No HIV-specific cytotoxicity was observed in seronegative subjects. Selective inhibition of the env-specific cytotoxicity by a CD3-specific monoclonal antibody indicates that the effectors are T cells.

Is the inferior relative survival in Denmark due to differences in morphology or stage of lung cancers? The present study compared in detail the survival of 92,719 patients diagnosed with lung cancer during 1978-1992 in Denmark, Finland, and Norway. In particular, differences in morphology and extent of disease were studied. A poor survival rate for small cell anaplastic lung carcinoma compared with all other morphologies was confirmed. However, this could not explain the relative survival differences observed between countries. Extent of disease was the most important predictor of survival. Part of the observed survival differences could be explained by a less favourable stage distribution in Denmark, combined with a slightly lower relative survival rate for those with metastatic disease. Differences in treatment are unlikely to explain the findings, although delays in diagnosing and treating patients in Denmark compared with neighbouring countries could partially explain the lower patient survival in Denmark. In conclusion, the main factor in the lower survival rate in Denmark is unfavourable stage distribution.}

An outcome event was the receipt, within a year, of a coronary procedure-angiography, angioplasty and/or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Socioeconomic status (SES) was assigned to each individual using the SEIFA Index of Disadvantage. Cox regression was used to model the association between SES and procedure rates in five consecutive three-year time periods. Angiography and CABG showed socioeconomic lags in diffusion, with rates peaking earlier in higher SES patients, such that the inequality patterns were consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis. The evidence for a lag in diffusion for angioplasty was weaker. Overall, that there is some evidence for a lag in diffusion of health technology indicates that it is essential to consider trends over time when examining the equity impact of health technologies.},

Around 1990, a more rapid incidence increase began in all Nordic countries except Denmark, where an increase was seen 5 years later. In 2001, incidence rates in Denmark were half of those seen in the other Nordic countries, but mortality rates varied only marginally among countries. Mean annual declines in prostate cancer mortality of 1.9\% (95\% CI = 0.4\% to 3.3\%) and 1.8\% (95\% CI = 0.5\% to 3.0\%) were observed from 1996 to 2004 in Finland and Norway, respectively. During the same period, mortality rates leveled off in Iceland and Sweden but continued to increase in Denmark. The rapid increase in incidence during the early 1990s coincided with the introduction of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and conveys little information about the occurrence of potentially lethal disease. Mortality rates, however, have recently stabilized or declined in countries where PSA testing and curative treatment have been commonly practiced since the late 1980s. Although other explanatory factors may be in operation, these trends are consistent with a moderate effect of increased curative treatment of early diagnosed prostate cancer and improved treatment of more advanced disease.}

METHODS: We performed a qualitative meta-analysis of interventions designed to improve follow-up after an abnormal Pap smear and included studies that met the following criteria: randomized or concurrently controlled study design, defined outcomes, and data available for abstraction. Interventions were classified as behavioral, cognitive, sociologic, or combined strategies (e.g., behavioral and cognitive). Abnormal Pap smears were defined as any test result requiring additional follow-up. Effectiveness was measured by the rate of compliance with recommended follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-two interventions in 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Cognitive interventions utilizing interactive telephone counseling were the most effective, improving compliance by 24 to 31\%. Behavioral interventions, such as patient reminders, were also effective, increasing follow-up by up to 18\%. Not all of these results achieved statistical significance. The single sociologic intervention we identified used video-taped peer discussions to provide a message about abnormal Pap smears and appropriate follow-up. This intervention was not associated with increased follow-up after an abnormal test. The effectiveness of interventions using multiple types of strategies to improve follow-up was inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive strategies led to the greatest improvement in compliance with follow-up of abnormal Pap smear screening tests. Extension of similar interventions to follow-up of abnormal breast and colon cancer screening, development of physician- and system-targeted interventions, and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of these strategies are important priorities for future research.}

For this purpose, ex post predictions produced by each method are checked for different cancer sites using data from the Cancer Control Region of Turku in Finland. In addition, the behaviour of the estimators of predicted expected values and prediction intervals, crucial for investigation of the reliability of prediction, are assessed using a simulation study. The prediction method making use of the Poisson assumption appeared to be the most reliable of the three approaches. The simulation study found that the estimator of the length of the prediction interval produced by this method has the smallest coverage error and is the most precise.}

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of colorectal cancer test behaviour within the last five years by faecal occult blood test (FOBT), or by any test (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 36.2\% of participants reported colorectal cancer testing and 17.9\% reported having a FOBT. Both FOBT and any testing were reduced significantly in groups with the following attributes compared with the remaining population; ages 50-59 and 80+; female; no family history of colorectal cancer; lower education; lower income; not speaking English at home; lack of private health insurance; not being retired; not living with a partner and not having other screening tests. Compared with other participants, test uptake was particularly low among current smokers (relative risk 0.76, 95\% CI 0.71-0.80), sedentary participants (0.71, 95\% CI 0.66-0.77), those without fruit (0.77, 95\% CI 0.71-0.84) or vegetables (0.79, 95\% CI 0.69-0.90) in their daily diet and those with a disability (0.91, 95\% CI 0.85-0.97). Compared with participants from major cities, outer regional area participants were significantly more likely to report a FOBT (1.31, 95\% CI 1.23-1.39) however participants in remote areas were significantly less likely to have had any colorectal cancer test (0.75, 95\% CI 0.67-0.85). CONCLUSION: Subgroups of the Australian population may require targeted intervention to ensure equity in colorectal cancer screening.},

In this paper, we describe the trends in the usage of adjuvant systemic treatment in the period 1975-1997 in the Netherlands. The main aim of our study was to assess the effects of adjuvant tamoxifen and polychemotherapy on breast cancer mortality, compared to the effects of the mammography screening programme. The computer simulation model MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis, which simulates demography, natural history of breast cancer and screening effects, was used to estimate the effects. Use of adjuvant therapy increased over time, but since 1990 it remained rather stable. Nowadays, adjuvant therapy is given to 88\% of node-positive patients aged 50-69 years, while less than 10\% of node-negative patients receive any kind of adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant treatment is given independent of the mode of detection (adjusted by nodal status and size). We predict that the reduction in breast cancer mortality due to adjuvant therapy is 7\% in women aged 55-74 years, while the reduction due to screening, which was first implemented in women aged 50-69 years in 1990-97, will be 28-30\% in 2007. In conclusion, although adjuvant systemic therapy can reduce breast cancer mortality rates, it is anticipated to be less than the mortality reduction caused by mammography screening.}

We developed a model-based period analysis approach aimed to overcome both problems. We provide extensive empirical evaluation of our approach by comparing its performance with that of previously available methods for monitoring of 5- and 10-year relative survival, with the use of data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry of 490,279 patients ages {\textgreater}/=15 years and diagnosed with one of 20 common forms of cancer between 1953 and 1997. We show that, in most cases, the model-based approach predicts 5- and 10-year relative survival expectations of newly diagnosed patients quite closely and much better than any of the previously available methods, including standard period analysis. We conclude that the model-based approach may enable deriving up-to-date cancer survival rates even with the common latency in availability of cancer registry data.}

DESIGN: Twenty seroconverters with HIV isolates available at seroconversion had HIV RNA quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at seroconversion and thereafter every 6 months. Mean follow-up time was 65 months. Patients were classified according to viral phenotype at seroconversion, time to AIDS progression, serum viral load within the first year (less or more than 1.5 x 10(4) copies/ml). RESULTS: High viral load at seroconversion was followed by a significant decline within the first months (P {\textless} 0.0005). Decline to {\textless} 1.5 x 10(4) copies/ml was correlated with slower progression to AIDS (P {\textless} 0.05). A correlation between the rate of CD4 decline and the median viral load during the ensuing viral load plateau phase was also shown (P {\textless} 0.05). Subsequent to this phase the viral burden increased. Rapid progressors had higher viral load than slow- or non-progressors; this was particularly pronounced late in infection. Harbouring syncytium-inducing (SI) virus at seroconversion was associated with faster progression to AIDS than non-SI (NSI; P {\textless} 0.005). The increased in vitro replication rate of SI over NSI was not translated into significantly higher serum HIV RNA. CONCLUSION: Serum HIV RNA is high around the time of seroconversion. A significant decline within the first months hereafter is followed by a plateau phase, which in turn is followed by an increase in HIV RNA. HIV RNA early in infection has a predictive value for the clinical outcome. The increased virulence of SI over NSI virus did not translate into significantly higher HIV RNA values.}

The objective of this study was to examine population data on breast cancer screening and breast cancer mortality to see if there is any geographic association between mammographic screening and breast cancer mortality reduction in the US, after adjusting for therapy use. METHODS: Regression analysis of the estimated annual percent reduction of breast cancer mortality was performed on mammography use from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) at state level. A secondary regression analysis on the SEER-11 region, at an aggregated Health Services Area (HSA) level, was carried out to adjust for use of adjuvant therapy. The annual percent change in the incidence of early stage cancer, calculated from SEER cancer data was used as a surrogate for mammography use. Adjuvant therapy use was estimated from SEER data and adjusted using the Patterns of Care data. All the analyses showed a small but significant negative correlation between mammography usage and mortality reduction (correlation of -0.285, p-value 0.045) in breast cancer (state level) and change in "early" stage breast cancer and mortality reduction (at HSA level) unadjusted (correlation of -0.307, p-value 0.065) and adjusted (partial correlation of -0.337, p-value 0.044) for adjuvant therapy use. DISCUSSION: The results of the two analyses appear to show a moderate effect of mammography usage on decreasing breast cancer mortality in the US, which seems to support the conclusions of randomized mammographic screening trials. While randomized controlled trials are certainly the gold standard in appraising the efficacy of new screening or treatment modalities, such trials are conducted under standardized conditions and do not always reflect the effect of these interventions at population level. This paper attempts to examine population level effects through ecologic analyses. Results, however, need to be interpreted cautiously owing to the limitations and biases inherent in such analyses.}

	annote = {Concurrent with increasing prostate cancer incidence and declining prostate cancer mortality in the United States, the prevalence of obesity has been increasing steadily. Several studies have reported that obesity is associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality, and it is thus likely that the increase in obesity has increased the burden of prostate cancer. In this study, we assess the potential effect of increasing obesity on prostate cancer incidence and mortality. We first estimate obesity-associated relative risks of low- and high-grade prostate cancer using data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Then, using obesity prevalence data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and prostate cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we convert annual grade-specific prostate cancer incidence rates into incidence rates conditional on weight category. Next, we combine the conditional incidence rates with the 1980 prevalence rates for each weight category to project annual grade-specific incidence under 1980 obesity levels. We use a simulation model based on observed survival and mortality data to translate the effects of obesity trends on prostate cancer incidence into effects on disease-specific mortality. The predicted increase in obesity prevalence since 1980 increased high-grade prostate cancer incidence by 15.5\% and prostate cancer mortality by between 7.0\% (under identical survival for obese and nonobese cases) and 23.0\% (under different survival for obese and nonobese cases) in 2002. We conclude that increasing obesity prevalence since 1980 has partially obscured declines in prostate cancer mortality.},

Survival analysis was performed considering AIDS development and death as endpoints. RESULTS: The median CD4+CD45RA+/CD45RO+ ratio was 1.3 (25-75\% quartiles, 0.9-2.4) in controls; it was increased to 1.8 (1.1-2.5) in 40 HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ cell counts {\textgreater} 500 x 10(6)/l (P {\textless} 0.05); it was similar at 1.4 (0.8-2.0) in 106 HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ cell counts of 200-500 x 10(6)/l; and it was decreased to 0.9 (0.5-1.4) in 154 HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ cell counts {\textless} 200 x 10(6)/l (P {\textless} 10[-6]). When fitted in a Cox model adjusting for the total number of CD4+ cells and age a lower concentration of CD4+CD45RA+ cells was associated with an increased risk of dying. The concentration of CD4+CD45RO+ cells was not significantly associated with AIDS or death in age- and CD4+ cell count-adjusted Cox models. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a selective loss of memory CD4+ cells early in HIV infection followed by increased loss of naive CD4+ cells in later stages of the infection. The loss of naive CD4+ cells seems to be important in the pathogenesis of terminal HIV infection},

Incidence has been uniformly increasing in the 24 countries with comparable data available, although in a few countries with very high rates (Sweden, Finland and The Netherlands), incidence has begun to fall during the last 3-4 years. The highest prostate cancer mortality rates are in the Baltic region (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Prostate cancer mortality has been decreasing in 13 of the 37 European countries considered - predominantly in higher-resource countries within each region - beginning in England and Wales (1992) and more recently in the Czech Republic (2004). There was considerable variability in the magnitude of the annual declines, varying from approximately 1\% in Scotland (from 1994) to over 4\% for the more recent declines in Hungary, France and the Czech Republic. There appears little relation between the extent of the increases in incidence (in the late 1990s) and the recent mortality declines. It remains unclear to what extent the increasing trends in incidence indicate true risk and how much is due to detection of latent disease. The decreasing mortality after 1990 may be attributable to improvements in treatment and to an effect of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. The increase in mortality observed in the Baltic region and in several Central and Eastern European countries appear to reflect a real increase in risk and requires further monitoring.},

METHODS: Five-year breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer relative survival rates from SEER are regressed on socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables at the county level. These models are first validated by comparing the observed rates with projected rates for counties not used in the estimation process. RESULTS: Education was the best indicator of longer cancer survival. Other important predictors of the geographical variability of survival varied by cancer site. Better survival was predicted for breast and prostate than for colorectal cancer. CONCULSIONS: Data from cancer registries can be used in ecological models to provide national and state estimates of patients' survival rates. These estimates are useful in targeting areas in which to promote earlier diagnosis or improved access to care, and may also aid in monitoring the quality of survival data collected by individual cancer registries.}

The authors examined the effect of a multiple birth cohort simulation on the incremental cost-effectiveness estimates of cervical screening programs, compared to a conventional single cohort simulation. The choice of hypothetical cohort that starts the simulation had a major impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates: Compared with a single birth cohort simulation, the incremental cost-effectiveness of a shift from biennial to triennial screening was 30\% higher when using the multiple cohort simulation. Multiple cohort simulations using the different age structures of 4 countries had little impact on the cost effectiveness ratios (variation {\textless}5\%). Future modeling-based evaluations of screening policies should better reflect the age range of the population that is targeted by carefully specifying the nature of the starting cohort(s).}

STUDY DESIGN: Cervigrams were obtained from 3134 women with a referral Papanicolaou smear diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Cervigram and cervical histology results were compared by using cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and CIN 3 disease end points. RESULTS: Of 3134 women, 444 had histologic findings of more than or equal to CIN 2 and 222 had CIN 3. Cervicography interpretation by using a threshold of greater than or equal to atypical had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 79.3\%, 61.0\%, 13.4\%, and 97.5\%, respectively, for detecting greater than or equal to CIN 3. Cervicography was more sensitive (80.8\% vs 57.1\%), but less specific (55.7\% vs 81.8\%), for detecting CIN 3 in women younger than 35 years compared with women 35 years or older, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cervicography functioned moderately well at detecting CIN 2 or CIN 3 in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion Papanicolau smear results. Cervigram sensitivity was better for younger women.}

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A rare but recurrent missense mutation (G84E, rs138213197) in the gene homeobox B13 (HOXB13) was recently reported to be associated with hereditary prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence and penetrance of HOXB13 G84E in a general population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: G84E and 14 additional HOXB13 polymorphisms were genotyped in two population-based, Swedish, case-control samples (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden [CAPS] and Stockholm-1) comprising 4693 controls and 5003 prostate cancer cases. CAPS collected data on patients and population controls nationally between 2001 and 2003. Stockholm-1 collected data on biopsy-positive patients and biopsy-negative controls in the Stockholm area between 2005 and 2007. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The outcome was pathologically verified prostate cancer. Relative and absolute risks among HOXB13 G84E mutation carriers were explored, as was the combined impact on disease risk of G84E and a polygenic score based on 33 established, common, low-risk variants. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: HOXB13 G84E was observed in 1.3\% of population controls and was strongly associated with prostate cancer risk (CAPS: odds ratio [OR]: 3.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-5.4; Stockholm-1: OR: 3.5; 95\% CI, 2.4-5.2). The strongest association was observed for young-onset (OR: 8.6; 95\% CI, 5.1-14.0) and hereditary (OR: 6.6; 95\% CI, 3.3-12.0) prostate cancer. Haplotype analyses supported that G84E is a founder mutation. G84E carriers have an estimated 33\% (95\% CI, 23-46) cumulative risk to age 80 yr of prostate cancer, compared to 12\% (95\% CI, 11-13) among noncarriers. For G84E carriers within the top quartile of a polygenic score of established susceptibility variants, the cumulative risk was estimated at 48\% (95\% CI, 36-64). CONCLUSIONS: HOXB13 G84E is prevalent in {\textgreater}1\% of the Swedish population and is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of prostate cancer. One-third of G84E carriers will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has implications for surveillance in mutation carriers.},

Central-axis depth-dose distributions were measured on and beyond the distal surface of the air cavities. The measurements were made with a parallel-plate Markus ionisation chamber and TLDs for 6 and 25 MV X-ray beams of field sizes 4 cm x 4 cm and 4 cm x 7 cm. Measured dose was then compared to calculated dose for the Clarkson Scatter Integration and Equivalent Tissue-air Ratio (ETAR) algorithms. Both algorithms show errors in dose calculation at the distal surface of air cavities mainly because they fail to account for the effect of electronic disequilibrium. The magnitude of prediction error is found to depend on energy, field size and cavity geometry. For a 4 cm x 4 cm field at 6 MV the dose difference between the calculated value and the measured value, at the distal surface of square cavity is 8.2\% and 13.7\% for the ETAR and Clarkson algorithm respectively while that for a 4 cm x 7 cm field, the dose difference is reduced to 1.4\% and 7.1\% respectively. In general the ETAR algorithm shows better performance than the Clarkson algorithm because the Clarkson method calculates scatter dose assuming a homogeneous water medium while the ETAR uses a weighted sum of scatter components which is density dependent. The measured data can be used as benchmark data in the development and testing of new photon dose calculation algorithms},

It is then tempting to use statistical variable-selection methods to reduce the number used for adjustment. Nonetheless, there is no agreement on how selection should be conducted, and it is well known that conventional selection methods lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow and p values that are too small. Furthermore, theory and simulation evidence have found no selection method to be uniformly superior to adjusting for all well-measured confounders. Nonetheless, control of all measured confounders can lead to problems for conventional model-fitting methods. When these problems occur, one can apply modern techniques such as shrinkage estimation, exposure modeling, or hybrids that combine outcome and exposure modeling. No selection or special software is needed for most of these techniques. It thus appears that statistical confounder selection may be an unnecessary complication in most regression analyses of effects.}

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of suicide among men diagnosed with PCa subsequent to PSA testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Prostate Cancer Base Sweden (PCBaSe Sweden) database, the Swedish Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish census database were used. The PCBaSe Sweden is a merged database that includes data from the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) for cases diagnosed between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006. The number of suicides registered for cases in the PCBaSe cohort was compared with the expected number of suicides in an age-matched general male Swedish population. MEASUREMENTS: Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for different categories of cases. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were 128 suicides among the 77,439 PCa cases in the NPCR compared with an expected number of 85 (SMR: 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.8). The risk of suicide was not increased for the 22,405 men with PSA-detected T1c tumours (SMR: 1.0; 95\% CI, 0.6-1.5), whereas the 22,929 men with locally advanced nonmetastatic tumours (SMR: 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-2.9) and the 8350 men with distant metastases (SMR: 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.2-3.6) had statistically significant increased SMRs for suicide. Potential effects of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions could not be investigated. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of committing suicide was observed among men with PCa diagnosed subsequent to PSA testing, whereas the risk was twice as high among men with locally advanced or metastatic disease, compared with an age-matched male population.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: In the presence of high-dimensional predictors, it is challenging to develop reliable regression models that can be used to accurately predict future outcomes. Further complications arise when the outcome of interest is an event time, which is often not fully observed due to censoring. In this article, we develop robust prediction models for event time outcomes by regularizing the Gehan's estimator for the accelerated failure time (AFT) model (Tsiatis, 1996, Annals of Statistics 18, 305-328) with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty. Unlike existing methods based on the inverse probability weighting and the Buckley and James estimator (Buckley and James, 1979, Biometrika 66, 429-436), the proposed approach does not require additional assumptions about the censoring and always yields a solution that is convergent. Furthermore, the proposed estimator leads to a stable regression model for prediction even if the AFT model fails to hold. To facilitate the adaptive selection of the tuning parameter, we detail an efficient numerical algorithm for obtaining the entire regularization path. The proposed procedures are applied to a breast cancer dataset to derive a reliable regression model for predicting patient survival based on a set of clinical prognostic factors and gene signatures. Finite sample performances of the procedures are evaluated through a simulation study.},

The highest risk will be suffered by men born around 1945-50, of whom about 1 in 150 will die of mesothelioma. Asbestos use in Western Europe remained high until 1980, and substantial quantities are still used in several European countries. These projections are based on the fit of a simple age and birth cohort model to male pleural cancer mortality from 1970 to 1989 for six countries (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Switzerland) which together account for three-quarters of the population of Western Europe. The model was tested by comparing observed and predicted numbers of deaths for the period 1990-94.

Estimates are derived by modelling incidence as an age-period-cohort function and by the equations relating specific cause mortality and prevalence to incidence and survival. The model parameters are evaluated by fitting mortality data by means of a weighted non-linear regression model. Numerical and statistical methods used to solve the regression and to compute standard errors, projections, and life tables are discussed. The program is written in standard FORTRAN 77 and runs on a mainframe computer. The different program units are illustrated together with the principal implementation options.

The general finding is that periodic starvation led to marked oscillations in raw mortality rates. The specific findings are as follows: (i) female medflies live longer than male medflies when they are subjected to periodic starvation; (ii) male medflies maintained on a full diet experience a catastrophic increase in mortality (40\%) on the first day food is removed. This mortality surge was not observed for females on either diet or for males maintained on a sugar-only diet; (ii) life expectancy is inversely related to the amplitude of mortality oscillations caused by food deprivation; and (iv) the large perturbations in mortality at younger ages caused by periodic starvation has little effect on the amplitude of mortality at older ages. In general, our data shed new light on the complexity of the mortality response of medflies to both the type and availability of food and thus provide a complimentary perspective to findings from dietary restriction studies on both vertebrate and invertebrate systems.}

In a previous model, trends in the utilization of adjuvant therapy were modeled only as a function of age and stage of the disease and not ER status. In this paper, we integrate this previous estimate on the use of adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer in the United States with information on ER status from the Patterns of Care (POC) data to estimate the dissemination of adjuvant therapy for women with different ER-status tumors. We also summarize efficacy of adjuvant systemic therapy reported in the overviews of early breast cancer clinical trials. These two inputs, dissemination and efficacy, are key pieces for models that investigate the effect of breast cancer adjuvant therapy on the decline of U.S. breast cancer mortality. METHODS: The adjustments to the previous models are calculated using the POC data on 7116 women with breast cancer diagnosed from 1987 to 1991 and in 1995 who were randomly selected from the Surveillance, and Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program registries. The POC data provide more accurate information on treatment and clinical variables (e.g., ER status) than the SEER data because medical records are reabstracted and further verified with treating physicians. RESULTS: Use of multiagent chemotherapy is higher for younger women ({\textless}50 years) and for women whose tumors were shown to be ER negative or borderline. The use of tamoxifen is higher among older women and women with ER-positive tumors. After 1980 the combined use of multiagent chemotherapy and tamoxifen for women diagnosed with breast cancer at ages 69 or younger increased more for women whose tumors were ER status positive or unknown than ER status negative. Older women ({\textgreater}69 years) seem to receive almost exclusively tamoxifen irrespective of ER status, except for a small percentage of those with more advanced stages (II- and II+/IIIA) who also receive multiagent chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: The estimated dissemination trends by ER status, based on modeling the POC data, reveal that treatment strategies with demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials have been adopted into practice. The dissemination and efficacy are the two factors necessary to input into models to determine the population impact of these therapies on U.S. breast cancer mortality. The largest decline in mortality would be expected for younger women ({\textless}60 years) with ER-positive tumors or whose tumors are of unknown status because of the largest efficacy and dissemination of adjuvant therapy in this group.}

It investigates infrequent screening and programmes in which as many women as possible are screened just once in their lifetime. It also compares the effectiveness of cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for primary screening. Different programmes are evaluated by a stochastic model of the progression of pre-cancer, its relationship to papillomavirus infection and the diagnostic accuracy of alternative screening methods. These are compared in terms of the impact on the incidence of invasive cancer and resource use. Important factors that determine the suitability of different screening programmes are the available resources and the expected population coverage. Blanket screening for women aged 30-59 years, with the aim of covering all just once in their lifetime, could reduce the incidence of invasive cancer by up to 30\%. A 10-year programme would require about 50\% more routine screening tests to bring about the same reduction in incidence and a 5-year programme about 2.5-3 times as many. With either approach it would be more effective for resource use to concentrate on screening women aged 30-59 than a wider age group. Whether HPV testing would be more effective as a primary screening method than cytology depends on the underlying prevalence of HPV infection, the accuracy of cytology, the cost and the suitability of the testing procedure under field conditions.}

A novel assay to detect IFNgamma secretion following HIV antigen stimulation of whole blood was developed to further assess the safety and immunogenicity of the FPV gag/pol-IFNgamma vaccine. Immunisation with FPV gag/pol-IFNgamma safely enhanced HIV-specific IFNgamma secretion following ex vivo stimulation of whole blood, greater than that observed following FPV gag/pol vaccination not co-expressing IFNgamma. Both HIV-specific IFNgamma-spot-forming cells by ELISPOT and CD69 expression by CD4+ lymphocytes were also enhanced following FPV gag/pol-IFNgamma vaccination. Hence, the FPV-HIV vaccine co-expressing IFNgamma stimulated HIV-specific T cell responses in macaques, and should be further evaluated as a therapeutic or preventive HIV vaccine.}

If these vaccines go on to demonstrate prevention of precancerous lesions in phase III clinical trials, they will be licensed for public use in the near future. How these vaccines will be used in countries with national cervical cancer screening programmes is an important question. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a transmission model of HPV 16 infection and progression to cervical cancer and calibrated it to Finnish HPV 16 seroprevalence over time. The model was used to estimate the transmission probability of the virus, to look at the effect of changes in patterns of sexual behaviour and smoking on age-specific trends in cancer incidence, and to explore the impact of HPV 16 vaccination. We estimated a high per-partnership transmission probability of HPV 16, of 0.6. The modelling analyses showed that changes in sexual behaviour and smoking accounted, in part, for the increase seen in cervical cancer incidence in 35- to 39-y-old women from 1990 to 1999. At both low (10\% in opportunistic immunisation) and high (90\% in a national immunisation programme) coverage of the adolescent population, vaccinating women and men had little benefit over vaccinating women alone. We estimate that vaccinating 90\% of young women before sexual debut has the potential to decrease HPV type-specific (e.g., type 16) cervical cancer incidence by 91\%. If older women are more likely to have persistent infections and progress to cancer, then vaccination with a duration of protection of less than 15 y could result in an older susceptible cohort and no decrease in cancer incidence. While vaccination has the potential to significantly reduce type-specific cancer incidence, its combination with screening further improves cancer prevention. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination has the potential to significantly decrease HPV type-specific cervical cancer incidence. High vaccine coverage of women alone, sustained over many decades, with a long duration of vaccine-conferred protection, would have the greatest impact on type-specific cancer incidence. This level of coverage could be achieved through national coordinated programmes, with surveillance to detect cancers caused by nonvaccine oncogenic HPV types.}

Patients were classified according to antecedent diabetes, and by blood glucose concentration at admission (quartile 1, {\textless}7mmol/L; quartile 2, 7 - 8.2 mmol/L; quartile 3, 8.3 - 10.9 mmol/L; quartile 4, {\textgreater}/=11 mmol/L). Multivariable models were constructed for determinants of mortality, including year of STEMI and demographic variables, entering blood glucose concentration and antecedent diabetes individually, and together. All-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality were 22.8\% and 31.3\% for patients with antecedent diabetes, compared to 16.3\% and 23.0\% respectively for those without. For glucose quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, crude 30-day mortality was 9.0\%, 10.6\%, 17.9\% and 31.0\%. Adjusted 30-day mortality risk was similar in quartile 2, higher by {\textgreater}80\% in quartile 3 and by {\textgreater}150\% in quartile 4, compared to glucose quartile 1. Antecedent diabetes was associated with an increase in mortality (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.52 (95\% CI 1.24 , 1.86)). On multivariable analysis (excluding glucose quartile), this reduced to 1.24 (0.98 , 1.58) and changed to a small, statistically non-significant reduction in risk when glucose quartile was added to the analysis (adjusted OR 0.87 (0.67 , 1.13)). Inclusion of antecedent diabetes in multivariable models did not add to the predictive value for mortality of glucose quartile (p=0.368). Similar relationships were observed for 1 year mortality. In patients with STEMI, blood glucose concentration shows graded association with risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality and is of greater prognostic relevance than antecedent diabetes diagnosis. Moderate elevation of blood glucose, below levels previously considered to be clinically relevant, is associated with adverse impact on survival.}

This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members;, this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution.The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive.The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January-June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.}

The aims of this study were to assess the effects of ARV use and increasing unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners (UAIC) in homosexual men on HIV incidence during 1995-2001 and to project HIV incidence depending on trends in ARV use and UAIC. METHODS: A mathematical model of HIV transmission among homosexual men in Australia was developed. HIV incidence during 1995-2001 was estimated assuming that 70\% of men in whom HIV was diagnosed received ARVs and assuming a 10\% annual increase in UAIC. For 2001-2006, scenarios included ARV levels remaining at 70\% or declining to 50\% by 2006, combined with UAIC levels remaining at the 2001 level or continuing to increase annually by 10\%. FINDINGS: The number of incident HIV cases per year was predicted to have declined during 1996-1998 due to the introduction of effective ARVs, with a slow increase during 1998-2001 due to increased levels of UAIC when use of therapies was fairly stable. From 2001, a continued increase in UAIC was predicted to lead to a rise in HIV incidence. A rise in UAIC combined with a moderate decline in ARV use could lead to a 50\% increase in HIV incidence by 2006. INTERPRETATION: These models suggest that widespread ARV use has had some effect in reducing HIV incidence among homosexual men in Australia. However, if current trends in UAIC and ARV use continue, a resurgent HIV epidemic is predicted.}

DESIGN: Smoking habits before 1980 (obtained from family or other informants) of 0.7 million adults who had died of neoplastic, respiratory, or vascular causes were compared with those of a reference group of 0.2 million who had died of other causes. SETTING: 24 urban and 74 rural areas of China. SUBJECTS: One million people who had died during 1986-8 and whose families could be interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tobacco attributable mortality in middle or old age from neoplastic, respiratory, or vascular disease. RESULTS: Among male smokers aged 35-69 there was a 51\% (SE 2) excess of neoplastic deaths, a 31\% (2) excess of respiratory deaths, and a 15\% (2) excess of vascular deaths. All three excesses were significant (P{\textless}0.0001). Among male smokers aged {\textgreater}/70 there was a 39\% (3) excess of neoplastic deaths, a 54\% (2) excess of respiratory deaths, and a 6\% (2) excess of vascular deaths. Fewer women smoked, but those who did had tobacco attributable risks of lung cancer and respiratory disease about the same as men. For both sexes, the lung cancer rates at ages 35-69 were about three times as great in smokers as in non-smokers, but because the rates among non-smokers in different parts of China varied widely the absolute excesses of lung cancer in smokers also varied. Of all deaths attributed to tobacco, 45\% were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 15\% to lung cancer; oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, tuberculosis, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease each caused 5-8\%. Tobacco caused about 0.6 million Chinese deaths in 1990 (0.5 million men). This will rise to 0.8 million in 2000 (0.4 million at ages 35-69) or to more if the tobacco attributed fractions increase. CONCLUSIONS: At current age specific death rates in smokers and non-smokers one in four smokers would be killed by tobacco, but as the epidemic grows this proportion will roughly double. If current smoking uptake rates persist in China (where about two thirds of men but few women become smokers) tobacco will kill about 100 million of the 0.3 billion males now aged 0-29, with half these deaths in middle age and half in old age.}

Comparison between groups was by Cox regression in both intention-to-treat analyses and efficacy analyses based on treatment actually taken. Median follow-up time was 232 weeks. Four cases of lung cancer and 3 cases of mesothelioma were observed in subjects randomised to retinol and 6 cases of lung cancer and 12 cases of mesothelioma in subjects randomised to beta-carotene. The relative rate of mesothelioma (the most common single cause of death in our study) for those on retinol compared with those on beta-carotene was 0.24 (95\% CI 0.07-0.86). In the retinol group, there was also a significantly lower rate for death from all causes but a higher rate of ischaemic heart disease mortality. Similar results were found with efficacy analyses. Our results confirm other findings of a lack of any benefit from administration of large doses of synthetic beta-carotene. The finding of significantly lower rates of mesothelioma among subjects assigned to retinol requires further investigation.}

The UrEpik study is introduced in the 'Comments' section and the results of the study will appear in a series of papers published over the next few months. They will give a new insight into many aspects of LUTS. Authors from London investigate the place of urodynamics in the evaluation of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder. They found that patients with such symptoms and with apparently normal urodynamic findings often respond equally well to antimuscarinic therapy as do those with positive urodynamic findings. They indicate that these findings cast doubt on the value of urodynamics in such patients before treatment. Authors from North America address the problem of mixed urinary incontinence. They examined the efficacy of tolterodine in patients with this condition and compared it with patients having urge incontinence alone. They found that it was equally effective in reducing leakage and other symptoms of overactive bladder in patients with mixed incontinence as in urge incontinence alone. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among men and women, as there are significant unanswered questions about the prevalence and impact of LUTS in different populations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional survey was completed in Boxmeer (the Netherlands), Auxerre (France), Birmingham (UK) and Seoul (Republic of Korea), using culturally and linguistically validated versions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The aim was to estimate the distribution of symptoms of LUTS in men and women. Stratified random samples of men aged 40-79 years in each community were collected. Postal questionnaires were used in Europe and direct interviews in Korea. RESULTS: In all, 4979 index men and 3790 women were recruited, with age-adjusted response rates among men of 72\% in Boxmeer, 28\% in Auxerre, 60\% in Birmingham and 68\% in Seoul. The percentages of men and women with an IPSS of 8-35, indicating moderate to severe symptoms, were, respectively, 20.7 and 18.0 (Boxmeer); 19.2 and 12.6 (Auxerre); 25.1 and 23.7 (Birmingham); 16.2 and 19.9 (Seoul). Among women the relationship between symptoms and age was not as strong as in men. The percentages of men and women with moderate to severe symptoms were by age group, respectively, 10.6, 15.5 (40-49); 19.0, 18.2 (50-59); 30.5, 23.8 (60-69); 40.4, 28.7 (70-79). Among those aged 40-49 the main differences between men and women were in the questions about frequency of urination during the day and holding back urine. Among the older groups men reported more symptoms on all questions apart from urination at night and difficulty in holding back urine, both of which were equally prevalent among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of LUTS was high and showed no marked cultural variation. Prevalence increased with age, with severe LUTS commoner in older men. Women reported similar levels of the symptoms traditionally associated with LUTS in men. In each age group there were no major cultural differences in the frequency of LUTS. There were differences with age between men and women; younger men had a lower prevalence of LUTS than younger women but older men a much higher prevalence than older women. These findings emphasize that the IPSS should be confined to within-patient comparisons and not used as a diagnostic tool. The IPSS performs very similarly regardless of gender.}

Changes in case definition are expected to have an impact on the time lag of case reporting. We propose a change-point model for reporting delays in AIDS that takes into account recent changes in the AIDS definition in US and European countries. The model was applied to California AIDS surveillance data and the distribution of reporting delays before and after the recent change of definition in 1993 were analyzed in terms of contributing factors. The overall significance of the model with change-point as compared to the model without change-point indicates that the effect of the 1993 change in definition on the distribution of reporting delays was highly significant (p {\textless} 0.0001). Overall, reporting delay of cases initially diagnosed with AIDS-defining diseases before 1993 was shorter compared to after 1993; reporting delay of cases initially diagnosed meeting the 1993 immunologic case definition was shorter than of those initially diagnosed with AIDS-defining diseases. Region of residence, mode of exposure, race/ethnicity and time of diagnosis emerged as the main covariates in the models. The method introduced here applies to current and possible future changes of the AIDS case definition as well as changes in diagnostic criteria or case definition in diseases other than AIDS. We demonstrate that such changes may be accompanied by sizeable changes in the distribution of reporting delays, and thus adjustment for reporting delays must be recalibrated after a change in definition.},

METHOD: Data from nearly 10,000 screening episodes between July 1988 and June 2001 on Victorian workers at high risk were assessed. RESULTS: Most participants were male (86\%) and employed in Victorian abattoirs (81\%). Agreement between results of tests for immunity was 'fair' (kappa=0.52). Self-reported history of vaccination or infection was a poor predictor of immunity. The proportion of positive blood and skin tests increased with years of exposure to animals/meat, but decreased over the 13-year period with shorter exposures. Hence the percentage requiring vaccination increased from 50\% in 1998 to 90\% in 2001. The average annual risk of infection among abattoir workers was 45.0 per 1,000 (95\% CI 42.3-47.6), and 62.6 per 1,000 (95\% CI 57.5-67.7) over the first 10 years of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Australian study to estimate the annual risk of Q fever infection in abattoir workers. The study confirmed previous findings of poor agreement between screening tests and predictive value of history of vaccination/ exposure. Up to 90\% of new entrants in high-risk workplaces will be susceptible to Q fever and require vaccination. IMPLICATIONS: Systematic post-marketing surveillance is needed to monitor adverse events to the vaccine, duration of protection and possible reasons for vaccine failures.}

The majority of studies have failed to identify such predictors. Possible reasons for this failure include the small sample size of most studies, samples homogeneous with respect to the study factors of interest, and the use of statistical procedures that are insensitive to individual differences or that inadequately control for confounding. We have reanalyzed data from Ciba-Geigy's large, multicenter clinical trial of clomipramine for obsessive-compulsive disorder, using stratification and regression techniques to identify multiple prognostic factors and control for confounders. We assessed the relationship between therapeutic response and baseline measures such as severity of symptoms, type of symptoms (obsessions, compulsions, depression), length of illness, age of onset, and other demographic factors (age, race, and sex). We found age of onset to be a strong predictor of response to clomipramine: people who develop obsessive-compulsive disorder later in life have a better chance of responding than do those who become ill earlier, independent of length of illness. We also found that baseline depression is associated with response, but the association appears to be nonlinear.}

We aimed to address these issues. METHODS: We studied CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA values every 4 weeks for 72 weeks in 154 patients starting indinavir-containing regimens. RESULTS: Mean baseline HIV RNA and CD4 count were 4.8 log10 copies/ml and 180 x 10(6) cells/l, respectively. Overall, there was a mean increase in CD4 count of 143 x 10(6) cells/l by 72 weeks. The adjusted mean increase (adjusted for initial viral load, CD4 count and age) was strongly related to the mean viral suppression over the follow-up period (P {\textless} 0.0001). Importantly, there was a highly significant difference (P = 0.0004) in the rise in CD4 count between those with 2-3 log suppression (161 x 10(6) cells/l) and those with {\textgreater} 3 log suppression (314 x 10(6) cells/l; mean 3.6 log suppression in this group), suggesting that with even greater suppression the rise in CD4 lymphocytes may be still larger. We also studied whether CD4 counts were still rising after 72 weeks in patients with sustained suppression of at least 3 log in viral load. There was a significant (P = 0.004; paired t-test) rise in count of 43 x 10(6) cells/l between weeks 64 and 72 in these patients, suggesting that regeneration continues at least up to 72 weeks after therapy, provided virus replication continues to be suppressed. Patients with initial CD4 counts {\textless} 10 x 10(6) cells/l experienced no smaller rises than those at higher levels, even after adjustment for other factors. CONCLUSION: These results strongly support a direct causal relationship between HIV replication and CD4 lymphocyte count depletion. The rise in those with {\textgreater} 3 log suppression provides the best available indicator of the potential for natural CD4 regeneration in HIV-infected patients. However, since still greater CD4 count rises may be seen with more suppressive regimens, it may not be possible to study the intrinsic CD4 regenerative capacity until such regimens are available},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Making an informed decision about treating a prostate cancer detected after a routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test requires knowledge about disease natural history, such as the chances that it would have been clinically diagnosed in the absence of screening and that it would metastasize or lead to death in the absence of treatment.


METHODS

We use three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to project risks of clinical progression events and disease-specific deaths for PSA-detected cases assuming they receive no primary treatment.


RESULTS

The three models project that 20\%-33\% of men have preclinical onset; of these 38\%-50\% would be clinically diagnosed and 12\%-25\% would die of the disease in the absence of screening and primary treatment. The risk that men age less than 60 at PSA detection with Gleason score 2-7 would be clinically diagnosed in the absence of screening is 67\%-93\% and would die of the disease in the absence of primary treatment is 23\%-34\%. For Gleason score 8 to 10 these risks are 90\%-96\% and 63\%-83\%.


CONCLUSIONS

Risks of disease progression among untreated PSA-detected cases can be nontrivial, particularly for younger men and men with high Gleason scores. Model projections can be useful for informing decisions about treatment.


IMPACT

This is the first study to project population-based natural history summaries in the absence of screening or primary treatment and risks of clinical progression events following PSA detection in the absence of primary treatment.},

Cost estimates vary across data sources, patient populations, and methods, however, the objective of this study was to compare 3 approaches for estimating the prevalence costs of colorectal cancer (CRC) care using different data sources, but similar patient populations and methods. METHODS: We identified prevalent CRC patients aged 65 and older from: (1) linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry-Medicare data, (2) Medicare claims only, and (3) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Controls were matched by sex, age-group, and geographic location. Mean per person total and net costs, measured as the difference between patients and controls, were compared for each approach during a similar observation period. The SEER-Medicare approach was our reference, and we evaluated the impact of patient selection criteria with sensitivity analyses. Aggregate prevalence estimates were also compared. RESULTS: We found considerable variability across the different approaches to estimating prevalence costs of CRC. Mean net annual per person estimates in the SEER-Medicare reference were \$5341 (95\% CI: \$5243, \$5439), compared with \$8736 (95\% CI: \$8203, \$9269) for the Medicare claims only and \$11,614 (95\% CI: \$7566, \$15,663) for the MEPS. Aggregate national estimates of net prevalence costs of CRC in 2004 ranged from \$4524 million, using the SEER-Medicare approach, to \$9629 million, using the MEPS approach. Estimates varied by data source based on the payors included and identification of prevalent CRC patients. CONCLUSIONS: CRC prevalence cost estimates vary substantially depending on the data sources. Our findings have implications for estimating prevalence costs for other cancers and other diseases without registry systems that can be used to identify newly diagnosed individuals as well as those diagnosed less recently.},

A population-wide sample of men younger than 70 years and newly diagnosed with prostate cancer was surveyed to determine their unmet needs in five domains and the factors predicting them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible men were younger than 70 years and residents in New South Wales, Australia, with newly diagnosed histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer. Sixty-seven percent of eligible men diagnosed between October 2000 and October 2001 participated. Demographic, treatment, and self-reported health data were collected. Information on cancer stage, grade, and prostate-specific antigen was obtained from medical records. Logistic regression analyses determined patient and treatment variables that predicted higher unmet needs. RESULTS: More than half (54\%) of men with prostate cancer expressed some level of unmet psychological need, and 47\% expressed unmet sexuality needs. Nearly one fourth expressed a moderate or high level of unmet need with respect to changes in sexuality. Sexuality needs were independently predicted by being younger, having had a secondary school education only, having had surgery, and being married, living as married, or divorced. Uncertainty about the future was also an important area of unmet need. CONCLUSION: Attention should be given to sexual and psychological needs in the early months after diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in younger men, those with less education, and those having surgery. Research into better ways of meeting these needs will enable us to meet them with as much rigor as we meet clinical treatment needs.}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight cancer registries in the UK, covering more than half the population, provided data based on {\textgreater}1.5 million cases of cancer. Total prevalence was calculated using methods developed for the EUROPREVAL study, based on modelling incidence and survival trends. The prevalence of cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast (in females), cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate, melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined, was estimated for the UK for the end of 1992. RESULTS: Overall, approximately 1.5\% of males and 2.5\% of females in the UK population at the end of 1992 were living with a diagnosis of cancer. These proportions increased steeply with age, with approximately 7.5\% (7.3\% and 7.8\%, in males and females, respectively) of people aged {\textgreater} or =65 years living with a diagnosis of cancer. Of the individual cancers, by far the highest prevalence (almost 1\%) was seen for breast cancer in females; more than one in three of all living female cancer patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer. For males, around half of prevalent cases had been diagnosed {\textgreater}5 years previously and 30\% {\textgreater}10 years previously; for females, these figures were both higher, at approximately 60\% and 40\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of prevalence presented here comprise: recently diagnosed patients in need of treatment and monitoring; long-term survivors, some of whom will nevertheless eventually die from the cancer, while others may be cured of the disease; and patients in the terminal phase who are dying from the cancer. Further work should attempt to identify the proportions of patients in the different phases of care in order to optimise the use of prevalence estimates in health care planning.}

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development of cervical cancer and associated pre-cursor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and accumulated evidence suggests that incorporation of HPV testing could further refine screening programmes. HPV testing is discussed in the context of primary screening, for triage, and as a test of cure of treatment and possible value in developing countries. The high negative predictive value of a "double negative" cytology and HPV result could allow considerable changes in policy such as increased intervals between screening rounds, adjustment of age ranges for testing and schedule for return to routine screening post treatment. HPV testing for the triage of women to colposcopy with borderline or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cytology could be clinically effective, but may be limited in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or mild dyskaryosis by high HPV prevalence. Markers of HPV persistence harbour enormous potential to identify women at greatest risk of disease progression. Due to the diversity of existing cytology-based screening programmes, full cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV testing should be performed and assessed within local contexts.}

Less well known is that absence of confounding does not correspond to collapsibility of the person-time rate ratio or rate difference. For example, two study groups can have the same distribution of all risk factors and yet the crude rate ratio need not equal a common stratum-specific rate ratio. The present paper provides an example and explanation of this phenomenon. The discrepancy between nonconfounding and collapsibility in rate comparisons arises when person-time is a post-exposure variable whose distribution can be altered by the effects of exposure and other risk factors.}

However, because the two conditions share not only a similar hormonal environment within the prostate but also several common risk factors, it is possible that men with BPH may be at increased risk of prostate carcinoma due to these shared factors. METHODS: To elucidate this further, the authors used Swedish nationwide population-based record-linkage data to assess prostate carcinoma risk up to 26 years after the diagnosis of BPH among 86,626 men. RESULTS: Overall, relative to the general population, patients with BPH experienced little, if any, excess risk of prostate carcinoma (2\% excess incidence after 10 years of follow-up). However, patients with BPH with and without surgical intervention experienced different prostate carcinoma risk patterns. Those undergoing transvesicular adenomectomy had a significant 22\% lower incidence and a 23\% lower mortality after the first 5 years of follow-up and those undergoing transurethral resection had a significant 10\% higher incidence but a 17\% lower mortality. In contrast, after the first 5 years, patients with BPH who did not receive surgical intervention experienced significant excesses of both prostate carcinoma incidence (18\%) and mortality (77\%). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in prostate carcinoma incidence and mortality by BPH treatment type suggest that factors related to treatment or health reasons underlying the selection of treatment influence subsequent prostate carcinoma risk.

The results suggest that only those methods that are based on the estimable functions such as curvatures can be recommended for use in all circumstances. The other common approaches that give parameter estimates that are easier to interpret all have induced bias in the estimates. In particular methods based on the minimization of a penalty function to achieve identifiability are only of use if there is no change in the rates with time. Any drift in the rates tends to be expressed as a cohort-based trend. The methods based on individual records introduce a bias if there is a strong age effect in the direction of a decreasing cohort trend and a compensating increase based on period effects. The nonparametric testing method has little power to detect trends in the rates in small tables but ascribes a strong drift in the rates to both period and cohort trends. With careful interpretation, all methods estimate nonlinear components correctly.}

METHODS: The study population consisted of individuals who initiated HAART and had at least one follow-up visit. The primary end-points were discontinuation of any component of HAART for drug toxicity and discontinuation for failure. Survival analyses were performed to identify predictive factors for reaching the two end-points. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-two individuals initiated HAART; in 727 of them (84.3\%) this consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one protease inhibitor (PI). Over a median follow-up of 45 weeks, 312 patients (36.2\%) discontinued therapy: 182 (21.1\%) discontinued due to toxicity, 44 (5.1\%) due to failure. The probability of discontinuing HAART at 1 year was 25.5\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 21.9-28.9] due to toxicity and 7.6\% (95\% CI, 4.9-1 0.3) due to failure. Independent factors associated with discontinuation for toxicity were: gender [relative hazard (RH) = 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.80 for men versus women], type of treatment (indinavir-containing regimens, RH = 1.94; 95\% CI, 1.10-3.41 and ritonavir-containing regimens, RH = 3.83; 95\% CI, 2.09-7.03 versus hard-gell saquinavir) and time spent on treatment (RH = 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.98 for each additional month). Discontinuation due to failure was independently associated with the most recent HIV-RNA (RH = 3.20; 95\% CI, 1.74-5.88 for log10 copies/ml higher), and with type of treatment (indinavir-containing regimens, RH = 0.21; 95\% CI, 0.06-0.78 and ritonavir-containing regimens, RH = 0.23; 95\% CI, 0.04-1.26 versus hard-gell saquinavir). CONCLUSIONS: If the current HAART regimen caused no toxicity, less than 10\% of naive patients discontinue their first HAART regimen because of failure after 1 year from starting therapy},

Two approaches that adjust for unmeasured spatial covariates, particularly tobacco consumption, are described. The first includes random effects in the model to account for unobserved heterogeneity; the second adds a simple urbanization measure as a surrogate for smoking behaviour. The Ohio data set has been of particular interest because of the suggestion that a nuclear facility in the southwest of the state may have caused increased levels of lung cancer there. However, we contend here that the data are inadequate for a proper investigation of this issue.}

OBJECTIVE: To assess risk for progression of HIV disease in patients with CD4 counts of at least 200 cells/mm3 (stratified by the lowest previous CD4 count) and compare the rate of progression in patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3 with that in patients whose CD4 counts rebounded from less than 50 cells/mm3 to at least 200 cells/mm3. DESIGN: Prospective, observational multicenter study. SETTING: 52 HIV outpatient clinics in Europe. PATIENTS: Two groups were identified: those with CD4 counts of at least 200 cells/mm3 (group A) and those with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3 (group B). Group A was stratified according to the lowest previous CD4 count: at least 150 cells/mm3 (stratum 1), 100 to 149 cells/mm3 (stratum 2), 50 to 99 cells/mm3 (stratum 3), and 1 to 50 cells/mm3 (stratum 4). MEASUREMENTS: Patients were followed until a progression event occurred (first AIDS-defining event, new AIDS-defining event, or death) or until the CD4 count decreased to less than 200 cells/mm3 (group A) or increased to more than 50 cells/mm3 (group B). Incidence rates were based on a patient-years analysis and reported as events per 100 patient-years of follow-up; the relative hazards for progression were based on Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The overall rate of disease progression in group A was 3.9 per 100 patient-years (95\% CI, 3.5 to 4.3 per 100 patient-years), whereas in group B it was much higher (72.9 per 100 patient-years [CI, 69.0 to 76.8 per 100 patient-years]). In group A, the rate increased in patients with previous low CD4 cell count nadirs, resulting in a significant increase in the relative hazard for progression. The relative hazards for strata 2, 3, and 4 were 2.29 (CI, 1.30 to 4.03), 3.65 (CI, 1.94 to 6.85), and 2.94 (CI, 1.44 to 6.00), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in CD4 counts from very low levels to at least 200 cells/mm3 are associated with a much reduced rate of disease progression. However, a previously low CD4 cell count nadir remains associated with a moderately higher risk for disease progression among patients with CD4 counts of at least 200 cells/mm3},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast and cervical cancer are important causes of mortality in women aged ≥15 years. We undertook annual age-specific assessments of breast and cervical cancer in 187 countries.
METHODS: We systematically collected cancer registry data on mortality and incidence, vital registration, and verbal autopsy data for the period 1980-2010. We modelled the mortality-to-incidence (MI) ratio using a hierarchical model. Vital registration and verbal autopsy were supplemented with incidence multiplied by the MI ratio to yield a comprehensive database of mortality rates. We used Gaussian process regression to develop estimates of mortality with uncertainty by age, sex, country, and year. We used out-of-sample predictive validity to select the final model. Estimates of incidence with uncertainty were also generated with mortality and MI ratios.
FINDINGS: Global breast cancer incidence increased from 641,000 (95\% uncertainty intervals 610,000-750,000) cases in 1980 to 1,643,000 (1,421,000-1,782,000) cases in 2010, an annual rate of increase of 3·1\%. Global cervical cancer incidence increased from 378,000 (256,000-489,000) cases per year in 1980 to 454,000 (318,000-620,000) cases per year in 2010-a 0·6\% annual rate of increase. Breast cancer killed 425,000 (359,000-453,000) women in 2010, of whom 68,000 (62,000-74,000) were aged 15-49 years in developing countries. Cervical cancer death rates have been decreasing but the disease still killed 200,000 (139,000-276,000) women in 2010, of whom 46,000 (33,000-64,000) were aged 15-49 years in developing countries. We recorded pronounced variation in the trend in breast cancer mortality across regions and countries.
INTERPRETATION: More policy attention is needed to strengthen established health-system responses to reduce breast and cervical cancer, especially in developing countries.

In contrast, short-term age-conditional risk estimates, such as the risk of developing a disease in the next 10 years among those alive and free of the disease at a given age, are less restricted by long-term extrapolation of current rates and can present patients with risk information tailored to their age. This study focuses on short-term age-conditional risk estimates for a broad set of important chronic diseases and nondisease causes of death among white and black men and women. METHODS: The Feuer et al. (1993, Journal of the National Cancer Institute) [15] method was applied to data from a variety of sources to obtain risk estimates for select cancers, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and death from motor vehicle accidents, homicide or legal intervention, and suicide. RESULTS: Acute deaths from suicide, homicide or legal intervention, and fatal motor vehicle accidents dominate the risk picture for persons in their 20s, with only diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease therapy (for blacks only) having similar levels of risk in this age range. Late in life, cancer, acute myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's, and stroke become most common. The chronic diseases affecting the population later in life present the most likely diseases someone will face. Several interesting differences in disease and death risks were derived and reported among age-specific race and gender subgroups of the population. CONCLUSION: Presentation of risk estimates for a broad set of chronic diseases and nondisease causes of death within short-term age ranges among population subgroups provides tailored information that may lead to better educated prevention, screening, and control behaviors and more efficient allocation of health resources.}

It is not clear, however, whether the establishment of a pool of latently infected CD4(+) T cells can be blocked by early initiation of HAART after primary infection. The present study demonstrates that initiation of HAART in infected individuals as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection did not prevent generation of latently infected, resting CD4(+) T cells carrying integrated HIV-1 DNA as well as infectious HIV-1 despite the successful control of plasma viremia shortly after institution of HAART. Furthermore, there was no correlation between either the duration of HAART at the time of study (range: 0.2-17 months) or the time of initiation of HAART after the onset of symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection (range: 0.3-4 months) and the frequencies of resting CD4(+) T cells carrying either integrated HIV-1 DNA or infectious virus. These results underscore the rapidity with which latent reservoirs are established in primary HIV-1 infection and indicate that it is unlikely that early treatment during primary infection can prevent establishment of a pool of latently infected, resting CD4(+) T cells as long as treatment is initiated after plasma viremia becomes evident.}

After three more years of follow-up, we report estimated 10-year results. METHODS: From October 1989 through February 1999, 695 men with early prostate cancer (mean age, 64.7 years) were randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy (347 men) or watchful waiting (348 men). The follow-up was complete through 2003, with blinded evaluation of the causes of death. The primary end point was death due to prostate cancer; the secondary end points were death from any cause, metastasis, and local progression. RESULTS: During a median of 8.2 years of follow-up, 83 men in the surgery group and 106 men in the watchful-waiting group died (P=0.04). In 30 of the 347 men assigned to surgery (8.6 percent) and 50 of the 348 men assigned to watchful waiting (14.4 percent), death was due to prostate cancer. The difference in the cumulative incidence of death due to prostate cancer increased from 2.0 percentage points after 5 years to 5.3 percentage points after 10 years, for a relative risk of 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.88; P=0.01 by Gray's test). For distant metastasis, the corresponding increase was from 1.7 to 10.2 percentage points, for a relative risk in the surgery group of 0.60 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.86; P=0.004 by Gray's test), and for local progression, the increase was from 19.1 to 25.1 percentage points, for a relative risk of 0.33 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.44; P{\textless}0.001 by Gray's test). CONCLUSIONS: Radical prostatectomy reduces disease-specific mortality, overall mortality, and the risks of metastasis and local progression. The absolute reduction in the risk of death after 10 years is small, but the reductions in the risks of metastasis and local tumor progression are substantial.}

	annote = {AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women. Knowledge of the present and future burden of the disease at a regional and national scale is a major issue in Italy, where the frequency and coverage of screening programs vary considerably across the country. This study presents estimates and projections of the female breast cancer incidence, prevalence and mortality for Italy and all Italian regions in the period 1970-2010. METHODS: The estimates were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian cancer registries were modelled to obtain regional and national estimates of breast cancer survival. RESULTS: Breast cancer mortality has been declining from the late 1980s in the northern-central regions and from the mid 1990s in the southern regions Puglia, Sicilia and Sardegna. Stable mortality rates are estimated for the other southern regions in the 2000's first decade. The incidence rate in Italy is estimated as increasing until the late 1990s, and stable thereafter (93 per 100,000). The incidence curve is also estimated to flatten in many northern-central regions from the late 1990s or later. Rising incidence trends are estimated in all southern regions, with the exception of Puglia. About 8,500 deaths, 37,000 new diagnoses and 416,000 prevalent cases for breast cancer are estimated among Italian women in 2005. In the same year, the proportion of prevalent cases in the northern area (1221 per 100,000) is about twice that estimated in the South (685 per 100,000). DISCUSSION: The geographical variation in female breast cancer burden can be explained by the unequal distribution of screening. A more widespread screening activity in the southern regions would help to bridge the gap between northern-central and southern regions. Continuous monitoring of regional epidemiological indicators for breast cancer is crucial to evaluate the effect of different health measures taken to control breast cancer in Italy.}

An understanding of the variability of CD4 counts which occurs in the absence of HIV infection is essential to their interpretation. The sources and degree of such variability have not been extensively studied. OBJECTIVES: To establish reference ranges for CD4 counts in HIV-seronegative women and heterosexual men attending a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, and to identify possible differences according to gender and cigarette smoking and, in women, any effect of the menstrual cycle, oral contraceptive use and cigarette smoking. DESIGN: Female and heterosexual male patients attending a GUM clinic and requesting an HIV-antibody test were recruited prospectively. Results from an earlier study of CD4 counts in homosexual men were available for comparison. METHODS: Lymphocyte subpopulation analysis on whole blood by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The absolute CD4 count and percentage of CD4 cells (CD4\%) were significantly higher in women (n = 195) than heterosexual men (n = 91) [difference between the means 111 x 106/1 (95\% CI 41, 180) and 3.1\% (1.30, 4.88)]. The absolute CD4 count and CD4\% were also significantly higher in smokers (n = 143) than non-smokers (n = 140) [difference 143 (79, 207) and 2.1\% (0.43, 3.81)]. Reference ranges for absolute CD4 counts (geometric mean +/- 2SD) were calculated on log transformed data as follows; female smokers 490-1610, female non-smokers 430-1350, heterosexual male smokers 380-1600, heterosexual male non-smokers 330-1280. Among other variables examined, combined oral contraceptive pill use was associated with a trend towards a lower absolute CD4 count. Changes were seen in CD4\% with the menstrual cycle. CD4 counts and CD4\% did not differ significantly between heterosexual men and homosexual men (n = 45). CONCLUSION: There is a significant gender and smoking effect on CD4 counts. The effects of oral contraceptive use and the menstrual cycle warrant further investigation},

In addition, unpublished annual data, with more diagnostic detail, are made available for many cancer registries with 15 or more years of recent data. We describe the construction and composition of the CI5 databases, and provide examples of how they can be used to prepare tables and graphs comparing incidence rates between populations. This is the classical role of descriptive statistics: to allow formulation of hypotheses that might explain the observed differences (geographically, over time, in population subgroups) and that can be tested by further study.

METHODS: Data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality were obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry for 1972-2001, and corresponding annual populations obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Direct age-standardised rates in the yen20 year population were calculated using the 2001 NSW census population as standard. Proportional reductions in incidence and mortality since 1972-1974 were also calculated and related to key health service factors and to published NSW 5-year cervical cancer relative survival for similar periods. RESULTS: Declines in cervical cancer incidence (-10\%) and mortality (-20\%), and increased degree-of-spread specific survival following the introduction of universal health care in 1975 suggest effects of greater access to Pap screening, earlier access to diagnosis and treatment services, and improved effectiveness of treatment. Incidence plateaued during the 1980s, but mortality fell further (-7\%) due to an increased proportion of localised cancers (without change to degree-of-spread specific survival). The 1980s mortality reduction was a consequence of earlier diagnosis and/or secondary prevention, not improved treatment effectiveness or reduced incidence. A marked and sustained incidence decline to 2001 (-35\%) occurred after the introduction of the NSW Cervical Screening Program in 1992. This was followed 3 years later by a sustained mortality decline (-20\%). During the 1990s survival across all degrees of spread remained unchanged and the mortality reduction was due entirely to reduction in incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The substantial reduction of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in NSW over the last 3 decades is associated with important health service interventions that relate to control of cervical cancer, particularly the implementation of a population-based organised cervical screening program.}

To assess the need to offer screening in this group, we examined Pap results of women 65 and older whose charts were reviewed as part of a cancer screening study in two San Francisco hospitals. Two hundred thirty women (41\%) were 65 years of age or older (mean age, 73). Compared with younger women, they were less likely to have had a Pap smear during the past 3 years (61\% versus 72\%), less likely to have seen a gynecologist (24\% versus 34\%), and were more likely to have refused Pap screening (11\% versus 5\%). Of the 140 women who had Paps, five showed atypia (class II). None exhibited dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. Those with atypia were all nonwhite. One had had a hysterectomy; two had a history of previously abnormal Paps. Overall, women with a history of abnormal Paps were far more likely to be screened (91\% versus 58\%). Those who had had a hysterectomy were significantly less likely to be screened (51\% versus 68\%). These results showed a low rate of cervical dysplasia/carcinoma in older, low-income women. Although our sample was small, the low rate of abnormals may reflect the relatively high rate of prior screening in this population. Because older women are not likely to see gynecologists, primary care physicians should continue Pap screening in older women (including those with a history of hysterectomy) until a history of repeated, technically adequate, normal Pap smears is documented.}

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8062189},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested changing patterns of lung cancer incidence by histologic type. The observed time trends have been attributed to a change in the rate of cigarette smoking, changes in exposure to new environmental carcinogens, and changes in the criteria for the histopathologic diagnosis of lung cancer. The current study was designed to examine the incidence patterns of lung cancer by histologic type in Connecticut and to use this information to project the future trend of the disease in this population. METHODS This study was based on all the lung cancer cases reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry between 1960 and 1989. On the basis of this data set, crude and age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer were calculated by histologic type for each sex. The age-specific incidence rates are presented by calendar year and cohort year of birth. A regression model was used to identify birth cohort, period, and age as determinants of the observed time trends. RESULTS For the overall age-adjusted incidence rates, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma have stabilized in men, whereas they are still increasing in women. The incidence of adenocarcinoma has been increasing in both men and women, but there has been a much sharper incidence among females since the mid-1970s. An examination of age-specific incidence rates by birth cohort and the results from age-period-cohort modeling indicate that incidences of all three major histologic types of lung cancer in the recent birth cohorts either have started decreasing (squamous cell carcinoma) or shown a clear reduction in the rate of increase (adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma). This study, however, did not indicate an increase of bronchoalveolar lung carcinoma, which was reported by other clinically based studies. CONCLUSION While the overall age-adjusted incidence rates showed different incidence patterns for different histologic types of lung cancer, a decreasing or stabilized rate for all three major histologic types of lung cancer was observed in recent birth cohorts in both males and females. The observed incidence pattern is consistent with smoking trends over time including changes in smoking prevalence and the consumption of low tar and filter cigarettes. It is expected that if the current trend in tobacco smoking continues and if there are no major changes in other risk factors for lung cancer, a forthcoming stabilization or decrease in the rate of lung cancer incidence for all major histologic types (including adenocarcinoma) in both sexes in Connecticut could be anticipated.},

This article systematically evaluates the discriminating capacity of a large number of combination tests. METHODS: Free and total PSA were analyzed in stored serum samples taken prior to diagnosis in 429 cases and 1,640 controls from the Physicians' Health Study. We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set. RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA {\textgreater} 4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the overall diagnostic performance as expressed by the area under the curve did not differ significantly for the different tests. CONCLUSIONS: Tests combining total and percent free PSA show modest overall improvements over total PSA. However, utilization of percent free PSA below a PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL could translate into a practically important reduction in unnecessary biopsies without sacrificing cancers detected.}

We evaluated trends in the use of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and the combination of both treatments for early-stage breast cancer in the United States from 1975 through 1999. METHODS: Data on treatment of 217 508 patients diagnosed from 1975 through 1999 with stages I, II, and IIIA breast cancer were obtained from eight registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Models of dissemination were developed from these data after adjustment based on information from a series of population-based Patterns of Care (POC) studies that randomly selected case patients from the SEER registries. The POC studies included 7116 patients diagnosed from 1987 through 1991 and in 1995 who were eliminated from the SEER data used in this analysis. RESULTS: The modeled disseminations were generally compatible with the POC-observed proportions of each treatment. The use of multi-agent chemotherapy was higher among premenopausal women, and the use of tamoxifen was higher among postmenopausal women. The use of multi-agent chemotherapy for postmenopausal women diagnosed with lymph node-positive stage II+ or stage IIIA cancer reached a peak in 1983 and then decreased through 1986, indicating its substitution with tamoxifen. After 1986, the combined use of multi-agent chemotherapy and tamoxifen increased for almost all stages and ages. After the early 1990s, tamoxifen use in postmenopausal women with stage II+ or stage III breast cancer declined. CONCLUSIONS: The observed dissemination patterns suggest that the results of clinical trials are disseminated fairly rapidly to community-based physicians and their patients.}

Yet PSA screening has generated considerable controversy: it is far from clear that the benefits outweigh risks, in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. One way to shift the ratio of benefits to harm is to focus on men at highest risk, who have more to benefit than average. Neither family history nor any of the currently identified genomic markers offer sufficient risk stratification for practical use. However, there is considerable evidence that the levels of PSA in blood are strongly prognostic of the long-term risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Specifically, it is difficult to justify continuing to screen men aged 60 or older if they have a PSA less than 1 or 2 ng/ml; for men 45-60, intervals between PSA tests can be based on PSA levels, with 2-4-year retesting interval for men with PSA of 1 ng/ml or higher, and tests every 6-8 years for men with PSA {\textless}1 ng/ml. Men with the top 10\% of PSAs at a young age (PSA {\textasciitilde}1.5 ng/ml or higher below 50) are at particularly high risk and should be subject to intensive monitoring.},

However, whether this increased risk applies to men diagnosed subsequent to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of suicide among men diagnosed with PCa subsequent to PSA testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Prostate Cancer Base Sweden (PCBaSe Sweden) database, the Swedish Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish census database were used. The PCBaSe Sweden is a merged database that includes data from the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) for cases diagnosed between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006.

MEASUREMENTS: Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for different categories of cases. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were 128 suicides among the 77,439 PCa cases in the NPCR compared with an expected number of 85 (SMR: 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.8). The risk of suicide was not increased for the 22,405 men with PSA-detected T1c tumours (SMR: 1.0; 95\% CI, 0.6-1.5), whereas the 22,929 men with locally advanced nonmetastatic tumours (SMR: 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-2.9) and the 8350 men with distant metastases (SMR: 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.2-3.6) had statistically significant increased SMRs for suicide. Potential effects of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions could not be investigated. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of committing suicide was observed among men with PCa diagnosed subsequent to PSA testing, whereas the risk was twice as high among men with locally advanced or metastatic disease, compared with an age-matched male population.},

	annote = {The intervention protocol for an ovarian cancer screening trial should be efficient as well as effective, because it may become the standard of care if the trial demonstrates mortality reduction. To identify an efficient ovarian cancer screening protocol, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of selected single modality and multimodal screening strategies were estimated using a stochastic simulation model. Screening was simulated over a 30-year period in a hypothetical cohort of 1 million women aged 50 at the beginning of the period. The net present value of the cost per year of life saved was estimated for six protocols involving transvaginal sonography (TVS) and/or the tumor antigen CA 125. Internal and external validation was performed, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the ranking of the strategies. A multimodal strategy involving CA 125 with a threshold for positivity of either elevation above 35 U/ml or doubling since the previous screen, followed by TVS only if CA 125 is positive, was found to be efficient in the sense that no other strategies saved as many years of life at lower cost per year of life saved. Used annually, this strategy cost under \$100,000 per year of life saved over a range of assumptions. The model's predictions are consistent with results reported in the literature regarding the performance of TVS and CA 125. The multimodal strategy used annually or every six months was efficient compared to either ultrasound or CA 125 used alone, over a range of assumptions. Simulation of screening may be useful in selecting a screening protocol to be tested in a randomized controlled trial.}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment related morbidity following radical prostatectomy in men participating in the Goteborg randomised population-based prostate cancer screening trial. METHODS: In 1995, 20,000 men aged 50-64 years were randomly allocated (1:1) to biennial PSA-screening or to a control group not invited. A subset of prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2008 responded to questionnaires preoperatively and at 18 months postoperatively. The primary endpoint was patient-reported frequencies of erectile dysfunction as measured by the validated International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire and urinary incontinence as assessed by use of pads. Analyses were made according to intention to screen. FINDINGS: After 14 years of follow-up, a total of 1849 men were detected with prostate cancer (1138 screened versus 711 controls, excluding 7 cancers detected at autopsy in the control group). Overall, 1047 received treatment with curative intent and radical prostatectomy was performed in 829 cases (79.2\%). In this study, 294 of these men participated (205 screened and 89 controls). Of preoperatively potent men 79.1\% (91/115) in the screening-group and 90.7\% (49/54) in the control-group became impotent or sexually inactive 18 months postoperatively, whereas 14.3\% (29/203) of screened men and 20.5\% (18/88) of controls were considered postoperatively incontinent (regular use of pads). Extrapolated data yields that 120/10,000 more men become impotent and 25/10,000 more men will have the need of pads among men invited to regular PSA screening. The 'cost' per life saved at the same follow-up of screening is four men impotent and less than one man incontinent. INTERPRETATION: Despite the relatively high risk of erectile dysfunction and incontinence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, the excess burden of permanent side-effects after population-based screening can be regarded as relatively low, when related to the number of men saved from prostate cancer death. These data can be useful when calculating the harms and benefits of screening. However, the outcome on a population-level may differ from the benefit for the individual.},

These patients experienced an increased risk of progression to AIDS compared with those patients who were persistently p24-negative (relative risk 7.24; P less than 0.0001, Cox proportional hazards model). The relative risk was reduced to 5.42 (P less than 0.0001) after adjustment for age and cytomegalovirus seropositivity. After adjustment for the patients' declining CD4 lymphocyte count during follow-up, the relative risk fell dramatically to 1.97 and became non-significant (P = 0.2). p24-antigenaemic patients tended to develop AIDS at levels of similar CD4 lymphocyte counts to those who were persistently p24-antigen-negative (median CD4 lymphocyte counts, 70 and 50 x 10(6)/l, respectively). These results suggests that the association between p24 antigenaemia and the rate of progression to AIDS can be explained largely by a more rapid decline in CD4 lymphocyte count among patients with p24 antigenaemia than in those without. The major pathological effects of increased plasma viral load, as detected by the presence or absence of p24 antigenaemia, appear to act via progressive CD4 lymphocyte depletion},

In this paper we present some preliminary results concerning the goodness-of-fit of a variety of disease mapping methods to simulated data for disease incidence derived from a range of models. These simulated models cover simple risk gradients to more complex true risk structures, including spatial correlation. The main general results presented here show that the gamma-Poisson exchangeable model and the Besag, York and Mollie (BYM) model are most robust across a range of diverse models. Mixture models are less robust. Non-parametric smoothing methods perform badly in general. Linear Bayes methods display behaviour similar to that of the gamma-Poisson methods.}

Self-reported individual smoking histories are coupled with a long time series for the tax rate on cigarettes to construct a longitudinal data set. Estimates are obtained for the effect of above-inflation tax rises on the age of starting smoking and the number of years of smoking. The estimates of the tax elasticity of the age of starting smoking are 0.16 for men and 0.08 for women. The estimates of the tax elasticity of quitting are -0.60 for men and -0.46 for women.

Although it is hypothesized that including future medical care costs will offset the cost savings achieved through prevention, the magnitude of the effect is not known. The objectives of the present study are to develop a methodology for estimating the excess costs of care among colorectal cancer patients, including and excluding future costs of care, and comparing these results with previous studies that do not include costs in added years of life. Subjects in the study included those identified with colorectal cancer drawn from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database and an age- and gender-matched control group drawn from the general Medicare population. Using the Kaplan-Meier Sample Average estimator, we directly estimate expected 11-year costs, and then, with the addition of some simple extrapolating assumptions, determine expected 25-year costs. The latter time horizon captures lifetime costs for over 90\% of the cohort. Males results for discounted, stage-specific 11- versus 25-year excess costs: in situ, 22411 dollars versus 23494 dollars; Stage 1, 29365 dollars versus 32510 dollars; Stage 2, 28114 dollars versus 25263 dollars; Stage 3, 27397 dollars versus 19647 dollars; Stage 4, 3006 dollars versus 7837 dollars. Trends were similar for females. It can be concluded that adding costs of care in future years for those whose colorectal cancer is prevented owing to screening greatly alters the estimate of lifetime excess costs for colorectal cancer patients, and can produce negative results for advanced stage disease. The results emphasize the need to adopt a standard approach for dealing with future costs when evaluating lifesaving interventions for cost-effectiveness analyses.}

DESIGN: Federal government type, NSW State government type, and combinations of both Federal and NSW State government type were examined. Poisson regression models were stratified by sex and controlled for the effects of age, annual change in gross domestic product, sedative availability, drought, and both world wars. RESULTS: When both Federal and NSW State governments were conservative the relative risk of suicide for NSW men was 1.17 (p{\textless}0.001) and for women 1.40 (p{\textless}0.001) compared with both governments being Labor (1.00). A statistically significant linear trend (p{\textless}0.001) in suicide risk was evident across the continuum of Federal/State government combinations, from both Labor (lowest), to mixed (intermediate), to both conservative (highest). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher suicide risk was associated with conservative government tenures compared with social democratic incumbents. Results are discussed in terms of the differences underpinning conservative and social democratic government programme ideology, and their relevance to Durkheim's theories of suicide, social regulation, and integration.}

The images were transferred by modem to colposcopy quality control reviewers for a blinded interpretation, including assessment of image quality. Reviewers' and colposcopists' diagnoses were compared with histologic diagnoses using standard contingency table methods. RESULTS: Colposcopists and reviewers underdiagnosed 16.1\% and 25.3\% of subjects, and overdiagnosed 44.7\% and 19.8\% of subjects compared with histology, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater were 35.4\% versus 23.2\%, P {\textless} .0001, and 89.9\% versus 95.0\%, P {\textless} .0001, respectively, for colposcopists and reviewers.

A number of the studies have other obvious weaknesses. Publication bias is known to be a problem, with two very large prospective studies having reported only very limited results. For cancers of the digestive system, bladder and brain, there is little evidence of an association with ETS exposure. Some studies have reported a relationship with cancer of the breast, cervix or nasopharynx, but the overall evidence for these sites is inconsistent and inconclusive, as is that for total cancer incidence. All three studies of nasosinus cancer have reported a statistically significant association with ETS exposure, but they are small, control poorly for potential confounding and have other weaknesses. Taken as a whole, the epidemiological evidence provides little support for the view that ETS causes cancer of any of the sites considered.}

SETTING: An Aboriginal community in central Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 1034 Aboriginal people aged 12-40 years, resident in the study region, seen during the period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1998 for STI diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident rate of gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis per 100 person years. RESULTS: There were 313 episodes of incident gonorrhoea, 240 of incident chlamydial infection, and 17 of incident syphilis. For gonorrhoea, risk factors were age, substance abuse, and previous prevalent chlamydial infection with a rate ratio (RR) of 3.2 in people aged 15-19 years, 1.6 in people who abused alcohol, and 3.2 in women who had sniffed petrol on a regular basis. For chlamydia, risk factors were sex, age, and a previous history of STI with a RR of 2.7 in people aged 15-19 years. Similar factors were associated with an increased risk of syphilis but the associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study identified objective predictors of incident STI which can be used to target interventions and maximise their impact. The results of this study may well have relevance to indigenous communities in other countries that are faced with high levels of STI and substance abuse},

We aimed to identify the risk factors for lipodystrophy in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected adults on HAART. METHODS: Moderate or severe body-fat changes were clinically assessed and categorised as subcutaneous lipoatrophy, central obesity, or both, in all consecutive antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected adults who began HAART with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus at least one protease inhibitor from October, 1996, to September, 1999. A person-years analysis was used to calculate the incidence of types of lipodystrophy, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to describe the univariate and multivariate factors associated with progression to any lipodystrophy. FINDINGS: After a median follow-up of 18 months, 85 (17\%) of the 494 patients developed some type of lipodystrophy. The incidences of any lipodystrophy, lipodystrophy with subcutaneous lipoatrophy, and lipodystrophy with central obesity were 11.7 (95\% CI 9.2-14.2), 9.2 (7.0-11.4), and 7.7 (5.7-9.7) per 100 patient-years. An increased risk for any lipodystrophy was found among women as compared with men (relative hazard 1.87 [1.07-3.28]), heterosexuals (2.86 [1.50-5.48]), and homosexuals (2.17 [1.07-4.42]) as compared with intravenous drug users, with increasing age (1.33 per 10 years older [1.08-1.62]), and with the duration of exposure to antiretroviral therapy (1.57 per 6 months extra [1.30-1.88]) but not with any individual antiretroviral agent. The factors associated with an increased risk for lipodystrophy with subcutaneous lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy with central obesity were very similar to those associated with any lipodystrophy. The duration of indinavir use may represent an additional contribution for the development of lipodystrophy with central obesity (1.26 per 6 months extra [0.99-1.60]); p=0.064). INTERPRETATION: Risk factors associated with development of any lipodystrophy, lipodystrophy with subcutaneous lipoatrophy, and tipodystrophy with central obesity in patients infected with HIV-1 who were receiving HAART containing protease inhibitors are multifactorial and overlapping, and cannot be exclusively ascribed to the duration of exposure to an particular antiretroviral agent},

Methods of regression analysis are presented, based on Poisson process and proportional intensity assumptions. These include parametric and semiparametric approaches to model fitting, model assessment, and the treatment of random effects. In addition, insight is gained as to the central role of Poisson and mixed Poisson regression analysis of counts in these methods, and as to the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on semiparametric analyses. The methods in the article are based on the proportional intensity Poisson process model, for which an individual with given fixed covariate vector x has repeated events occur according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity function λ$_{\textrm{x}}$(t) = λ$_{\textrm{0}}$(t)exp(x'β). Estimation of β and the baseline intensity λ$_{\textrm{0}}$(t) are considered when λ$_{\textrm{0}}$(t) is specified up to a parameter θ, and close connections with the semiparametric methods due to Cox (e.g., Andersen and Gill 1982) are noted. Random effects are incorporated by representing λ$_{\textrm{x{\textless}sub{\textgreater}i}}${\textless}/sub{\textgreater}(t) as λ$_{\textrm{0}}$(t)exp(α$_{\textrm{i}}$ + x$^{\textrm{'}}$$_{\textrm{i}}$β), where the α$_{\textrm{i}}$'s are iid random variables. Details are examined and an example is given for the case in which exp(α$_{\textrm{i}}$) has a gamma distribution.},

Twenty-seven patients (10.9\%) had mutations in the RT, 5 (2\%) carried primary mutations in the PR, and 131 (52.8\%) showed only secondary PR mutations. Virologic failure at week 24 occurred in 62 (25.0\%) of 248 patients. There was a statistically significant correlation between virologic failure and the number of PR mutations (P= .04, chi(2) test). Mutations at codons 10 and 36 of PR (present in 39.3\% and 40.0\% of patients in whom treatment failed, respectively) were identified by stepwise logistic regression as the strongest predictors of virologic failure (odds ratio, 2.20; 95\% confidence interval, 1.30-3.75; P= .004).

METHODS: A large-scale population-based case-control study was incorporated into the nationwide retrospective survey of mortality conducted 1989 - 1991 in 24 urban cities selected by non-random sampling and 79 rural counties selected from 3000 counties included in the 1973 - 1975 cancer distribution survey by random sampling during. A questionnaire survey was conducted by home visit to investigate the death causes and smoking history of 19 734 deceased male adults who died of esophageal cancer during 1986 - 1988 at the age {\textgreater}or= 35. Two control groups were set up to undergo questionnaire survey by home visit to investigate the smoking history of the deceased persons and the informants. Control group I included the surviving spouses or other informants of 31 989 male adults who died of non-malignant digestive diseases during 1986 - 1988 at the age {\textgreater}or= 35, and control group II included 104 846 male spouses of the deceased female adults who died of different causes during 1986 - 1989 at the age {\textgreater}or= 35. The relative risks and population smoking attributable risks for EC were calculated using non-conditional logistic model, and the results were compared for consistency between the analyses using two different control groups. RESULTS: The EC absolute death rates were higher in the smokers than in the non-smokers in all urban and rural area groups. The total EC absolute death rate per 1000 among the non-smokers vs. smokers was 0.37:0.65 in the urban areas, 0.99:1.29 in the inland rural areas, and 1.09:1.62 in the coastal rural areas in the control group I, and there was a similar trend in the control group II. There was a significant dose-response relation between the period of smoking and the death risk of EC and between the daily cigarette consumption and the death risk of EC. The risk ratios, for example, for cigarette per day {\textless} 10, 10-, and 20- in the urban men were 1.42, 1.82, 2.22 in the control group I (trend test P {\textless} 0.01), and 1.57, 1.95, and 3.18 in the control group II (trend test P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Smoking is an important risk factor for mortality from EC in China. Investigating the surviving spouses of the deceased patients is a creative, effective, and feasible trial, with the prerequisite of whole population-based survey, in study of the main types of death and the relevant risk factors.}

In the earliest birth cohort for males (1897-1901) about 85 per cent were ever smokers (i.e. had smoked at some time). After the 1922-1926 cohort this started to fall, to reach the level of about 50 per cent in the 1962-1966 cohort. In females only 25 per cent of the earliest cohort ever smoked but this rose, reaching about 65 per cent in the 1922-1926 cohort before failing back to about 50 per cent in the 1962-1966 cohort. The age at which smokers quit appears to be falling in successive cohorts. Once they have started quitting the rate at which smokers do so is very similar in all cohorts, with about 1 per cent of ever smokers quitting each year. If these trends are continued the UK smoking prevalence targets will not be met.},

Such uncertainty can be quantified, especially if the investigator has some idea of the amount of such bias. A traditional sensitivity analysis produces one or more point estimates for the exposure effect hypothetically adjusted for bias, but it does not provide a range of effect measures given the likely range of bias. Here the authors used Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian bias analysis to provide such a range, using data from a US silica-lung cancer study in which results were potentially confounded by smoking. After positing a distribution for the smoking habits of workers and referents, a distribution of rate ratios for the effect of smoking on lung cancer, and a model for the bias parameter, the authors derived a distribution for the silica-lung cancer rate ratios hypothetically adjusted for smoking. The original standardized mortality ratio for the silica-lung cancer relation was 1.60 (95\% confidence interval: 1.31, 1.93). Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, adjusting for possible confounding by smoking, led to an adjusted standardized mortality ratio of 1.43 (95\% Monte Carlo limits: 1.15, 1.78). Bayesian results were similar (95\% posterior limits: 1.13, 1.84). The authors believe that these types of analyses, which make explicit and quantify sources of uncertainty, should be more widely adopted by epidemiologists.}

Unfortunately, one cannot identify these factors uniquely in the usual regression model owing to a linear dependence between age, period and cohort, so that one requires additional information about the underlying biology of the disease. Carcinogenesis models provide one type of information that can result in a unique set of parameters for the effects of age, period and cohort. We use the multistage carcinogenesis model and its extensions to obtain a unique set of parameters for an age-period-cohort model of lung cancer trends of Connecticut males and females from 1935 to 1988. Some of these models do not seem to provide a reasonable set of model parameters, but we found that a model that included second-order terms and a multistage mixture model both gave a good fit to the data and realistic parameter estimates.},

Some specific uses of HPV detection are a) triage of women with cytological determinations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and related management strategies, b) as a marker for test of cure post-treatment, and c) most importantly, as an adjunct to cytology in routine cervical disease screening programs. There are many studies that support each of these applications and include 8 studies on ASC-US triage, 10 on test of cure and 13 on adjunctive or stand-alone HPV screening. The most notable investigation of ASC-US triage was ALTS, a randomized controlled trial of 3,488 women. With respect to routine HPV screening the combined studies included 77,000 women, providing as a histological endpoint more than 1,000 cases of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer. Testing methods were either the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. HPV testing of women with ASC-US cytology had on average a higher sensitivity (90\%) and specificity (70\%) than repeating the cytological test (sensitivity 75\%, specificity 60\%) and was also more sensitive than colposcopy for follow-up. As an adjunct to the Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology test in routine screening, HPV DNA testing was a more sensitive indicator for prevalent high-grade CIN than either conventional or liquid cytology. A combination of HPV DNA and Papanicolaou testing had almost 100\% sensitivity and negative predictive value. The specificity of the combined tests was slightly lower than the specificity of the Papanicolaou test. One "double-negative" HPV DNA and Papanicolaou test indicated a higher prognostic assurance against risk of future CIN 3 than three subsequent negative conventional Papanicolaou tests and may safely allow three-year or longer screening intervals for such low-risk women. It appears that HPV DNA testing is on the way to becoming a common testing strategy in cervical cancer prevention programs. Research continues into approaches for improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of HPV detection methods. Hybrid Capture 3 will offer improved HPV typing capabilities and the Rapid Capture machine allows for robot-assisted HPV DNA testing, permitting greater test throughput. PCR test improvements are expected to contribute to the growth of flexible accurate and cost-effective HPV DNA tests. It is likely that improved diagnostic technology along with HPV genotyping and quantitation may provide more value in future. A particularly promising approach is to combine HPV DNA testing with expression levels of other markers such as proliferative or cell cycle regulatory proteins to subdivide HPV-positive women into those who are at greater risk of cancer and those who can be safely followed by screening at longer intervals.

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Prepaid health plan. PARTICIPANTS: All women diagnosed with ICC at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program-Northern California health plan from 1988 to 1994. MEASUREMENTS: From medical records, we recorded participants' age, stage at diagnosis, tumor histology, and results of and reasons for all previous cervical smears. We limited our analysis to women who had been members of the health plan for at least 30 of the 36 months preceding diagnosis (n = 455). RESULTS: Women in older age groups were less likely than younger women to have been screened within the 3 years before diagnosis (P = .005 for trend). Nonadherence to follow-up of abnormal cervical smears was uncommon (17/455, 3.7\%) and not age related (P = .932 for trend). The proportions of ICC that were interval cancers, defined as ICC diagnosed within 3 years of a negative screening smear, were highest in women under age 30 (P = .004 for trend). In multivariate analyses controlling for stage at diagnosis, women age 60 and older were not more likely to die of ICC within 3 years of diagnosis than were women younger than age 60 (odds ratio 1.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.75-2.28). CONCLUSION: The disproportionate burden of cervical cancer observed in older women appears to be largely attributable to lack of screening within the 3 years before diagnosis.}

A recent National Eye Institute-sponsored prospective, multicenter trial investigating the use of cryotherapy for treatment of ROP demonstrates a significant reduction in blindness and low vision for patients with sight-threatening (stage 3+) ROP. METHOD. A microsimulation model is presented to determine the cost-effectiveness of cryotherapy for ROP. Simulations are performed for three subpopulations of premature infants with birth weights 500 through 749 g, 750 through 999 g, and 1000 through 1249 g, and for three screening strategies--weekly, biweekly, and monthly. RESULTS. Appropriately timed screening for and treatment of ROP is predicted to result in a gain of 3899 to 4648 quality-adjusted-life-years and a net governmental budgetary savings of \$38.3 to \$64.9 million for each annual US birth cohort of 28,321 premature infants (500 through 1249 g). The cost per quality-adjusted-life-year gained is \$2488 to \$6045, depending on different screening strategies. CONCLUSIONS. Of greatest importance is the finding that properly timed screening and treatment for ROP is not only cost saving but may save approximately 320 infants per year from a lifetime of blindness.}

DESIGN: We analysed patients who started indinavir, ritonavir or saquinavir hard gel capsule (hgc) as part of at least triple therapy during prospective follow-up within the EuroSIDA study. METHODS: Changes in plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4 cell count from baseline were compared between treatment groups. Time to new AIDS-defining events and death were compared in Kaplan--Meier models, and Cox models were established to further assess differences in clinical progression (new AIDS/death). Adjustment was made for differences in baseline parameters, in particular pVL, CD4 cell count, and region of Europe. RESULTS: A total of 2708 patients (median follow-up: 30 months) were included, of which 556 started ritonavir (21\%), 1342 indinavir (50\%), and 810 saquinavir hgc (30\%). The three groups were fairly evenly balanced at baseline regarding CD4 count, previous diagnosis of AIDS and pVL, After 12 months, the median changes in CD4 cell count were 90, 96 and 74 x 10(6) cells/l, respectively;P {\textless} 0.001, the proportions of patients with pVL {\textless} 500 copies/ml were 47, 54 and 41\%; P {\textless} 0.001, and the proportions with clinical progression were 11.9, 9.2 and 11.9\%, respectively; P = 0.20 (log-rank test). In multivariate models the relative risk of clinical progression for indinavir compared with saquinavir hgc was: 0.77 (0.60--0.99); P = 0.043, and for ritonavir 0.83 (0.62--1.11); P = 0.20. CONCLUSIONS: Saquinavir hgc was associated with an inferior long-term clinical response relative to indinavir, which was consistent with the observed differences in virological and immunological responses},

OBJECTIVES: This article reviews methods for estimating the long-term medical care costs associated with a cancer diagnosis. METHODS: The authors consider data from administrative claims databases and describe the analytic challenges posed by these increasingly common resources. They present a number of statistical methods that are valid under censoring and describe methods for estimating mean costs and controlling for covariates. In addition, the authors compare two different approaches for estimating the cancer-related costs; namely, the portion of the long-term costs that may be attributed to the disease. Examples from economic studies of breast and colorectal cancer are presented. RESULTS: In an analysis of data on colorectal cancer costs from the SEER-Medicare database, the two methods used to estimate expected long-term costs (one model based, one not model-based) yielded similar results. However, in calculating expected cancer-related costs, a method that included future medical costs among controls yielded quite different results from the method that did not include these future costs. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical methods for analyzing long-term medical costs under censoring are available and appropriate in many applications where total or disease-related costs are of interest. Several of these approaches are nonparametric and therefore may be expected to be robust against the non-standard features that are often encountered when analyzing medical cost data.}

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted logistic regression and survival analyses in a retrospective cohort of long-term hemodialysis patients to examine the hypothesis that the induced iron depletion with resultant relative thrombocytosis may be a possible contributor to the link between the high rHuEPO dose-associated hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL or greater and mortality. SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: The national database of a large dialysis organization (DaVita) with 40,787 long-term hemodialysis patients during July to December 2001 and their survival up to July 2004 were examined. PREDICTORS: Hemoglobin level, platelet count, and administered rHuEPO dose during each calendar quarter. OUTCOMES \& OTHER MEASUREMENTS: Case-mix-adjusted 3-year all-cause mortality and measures of iron stores, including serum ferritin and iron saturation ratio. RESULTS: Higher platelet count was associated with lower iron stores and greater prescribed rHuEPO dose. Compared with a hemoglobin level of 12 to 13 g/dL, a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL or greater was associated with increased mortality in the presence of relative thrombocytosis, ie, platelet count of 300,000/microL or greater (case-mix-adjusted death-rate ratio, 1.21; 95\% confidence limits, 1.02 to 1.44; P = 0.03) as opposed to the absence of relative thrombocytosis (death-rate ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence limits, 0.98 to 1.08; P = 0.1). A prescribed rHuEPO dose greater than 20,000 U/wk was associated with a greater likelihood of iron depletion (iron saturation ratio {\textless} 20\%) and relative thrombocytosis (case-mix-adjusted odds ratio, 2.53; 95\% confidence limits, 2.37 to 2.69; and 1.36; 95\% confidence limits, 1.30 to 1.42, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001) and increased mortality during 3 years (death-rate ratio, 1.59; 95\% confidence limits, 1.54 to 1.65; P {\textless} 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Our results may incorporate uncontrolled confounding. Achieved hemoglobin level may have different mortality predictability than targeted hemoglobin level. CONCLUSIONS: Iron depletion and associated relative thrombocytosis might contribute to increased mortality when administering high rHuEPO doses to achieve hemoglobin levels of 13 g/dL or greater in long-term hemodialysis patients. Randomized trials are needed to test these observational associations.}

Such procedures, however, are quite fallible. We examine several errors that often follow the use of statistical adjustment. The first is inferring a factor is causal because it predicts an outcome even after "statistical control" for other factors. This inference is fallacious when (as usual) such control involves removing the linear contribution of imperfectly measured variables, or when some confounders remain unmeasured. The converse fallacy is inferring a factor is not causally important because its association with the outcome is attenuated or eliminated by the inclusion of covariates in the adjustment process. This attenuation may only reflect that the covariates treated as confounders are actually mediators (intermediates) and critical to the causal chain from the study factor to the study outcome. Other problems arise due to mismeasurement of the study factor or outcome, or because these study variables are only proxies for underlying constructs. Statistical adjustment serves a useful function, but it cannot transform observational studies into natural experiments, and involves far more subjective judgment than many users realize.}

Many test systems have been developed that can detect the broad spectrum of hrHPV types in one assay. However, for screening purposes the detection of high-risk HPV is not inherently useful unless it is informative for the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) or cancer. Candidate high-risk HPV tests to be used for screening should reach an optimal balance between clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of high-grade CIN and cervical cancer to minimize redundant or excessive follow-up procedures for high-risk HPV positive women without cervical lesions. Data from various large screening studies have shown that high-risk HPV testing by hybrid capture 2 and GP5+/6+-PCR yields considerably better results in the detection of CIN 2/3 than cytology. The data from these studies can be used to guide the translation of high-risk HPV testing into clinical practice by setting standards of test performance and characteristics. On the basis of these data we have developed guidelines for high-risk HPV test requirements for primary cervical screening and validation guidelines for candidate HPV assays.},

METHODS: We used a decision analysis modeling the cancer yield in a cohort screened by both screening tests, and the survival of cancer cases given screen detection and in the absence of screening. Expected cancer yields and positive predictive values were from an ultrasound-guided biopsy series. Stage distributions of screen-detected cases were obtained from the literature. For localized causes, survival given screen detection was assumed to be equal to normal life expectancy for the population. For these cases, survival in the absence of screening was modeled as time from clinical diagnosis to death added to time remaining after time of screen and before clinical diagnosis was made (lead time). For nonlocalized cases at screen detection, survival given screen detection was assumed to be equal to survival in the absence of screening. The average difference between expected survival with and without screening as calculated for age-specific PSA and for PSA {\textgreater} 4.0 ng/ml and compared. RESULTS: Average years of life saved per subject screened using PSA {\textgreater} 4.0 ng/ml were comparable to those using the age-specific bound. Average years of life saved per cancer case, however, appeared to be potentially greater for PSA {\textgreater} 4.0 ng/ml than for age-specific. PSA. PSA {\textgreater} 4.0 ng/ml detected markedly more prostate cancer cases than age-specific PSA. CONCLUSIONS: Using a bound of 4.0 ng/ml for all ages appears to be more efficient in identifying men with cancer in a screening cohort, which translates into a greater expected survival benefit per cancer case.}

The observed mortality was compared with expectation based on the death rates for England and Wales. For all causes the observed number of deaths was 2.6 times expectation and for lung cancer 9.1 times expectation. After 10 years from first certification half of the men had died compared with an expectation of one in four. The excess death rates were apparent in the first year after certification and were still operating after 10 years on those who survived until then. The main factor influencing the mortality was the clinical state of the men at the time of certification, as indicated by the percentage disability awarded; the excess lung cancer rate and the mesothelioma and asbestosis rates all increased with percentage disability. Those awarded only 10\% or 20\% benefit were still at risk from all the three asbestos-related causes. For a man certified at age 55 it was estimated that his life expectation would be reduced by 3, 5, 8, or 12 years according to whether his rate of disablement benefit was 10\%, 20\%, 30\% or 40\% , or 50\% or more respectively.}

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme of the National Cancer Institute has since 1973 provided annual age adjusted incidence for mesothelioma in representative cancer registries dispersed throughout the USA. SEER data are analysed to describe the trend of male mesothelioma incidence in the USA. RESULTS: The US male mesothelioma incidence data indicate that after two decades of increasing incidence, a likely decline has been observed since the early 1990s, when a highly significant change in the upward course occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing male mesothelioma incidence for many years was undoubtedly the result of exposure to asbestos. The high mesothelioma risk was prominently influenced by exposure to amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite), which reached its peak usage in the 1960s and thereafter declined. A differing pattern in some other countries (continuing rise in incidence) may be related to their greater and later amphibole use, particularly crocidolite. The known latency period for the development of this tumour provides biological plausibility for the recent decline in mesothelioma incidence in the USA. This favourable finding is contrary to a widespread fear that asbestos related health effects will show an inevitable increase in coming years, or even decades.}

To evaluate its validity and to compare its performance with that of another simple method for handling drop-outs: the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. DESIGN: Data from a notional treated group of 100 patients followed up to 52 weeks were generated. Attrition bias was introduced by mimicking selective patient drop-out (i.e., more likely in patients doing badly). METHODS: The difference between the true mean change in HIV RNA levels at 52 weeks and the observed mean change because of drop-outs was calculated (attrition bias). The reduction in bias obtained by using the proposed approach was then calculated and compared with that obtained by using the LOCF method. To assess the performance of the methods over the entire follow-up, the mean areas under the curves were considered. RESULTS: Our method reduced the bias by a clinically relevant amount in a variety of different settings. In most of our simulations, bias was reduced by a larger amount than that obtainable from using the LOCF method. CONCLUSIONS: The current situation is that results from trials in HIV infection are invariably presented with no associated attempt to quantify the attrition bias present. Attrition-adjusted plots of mean change in HIV RNA should, we believe, be presented alongside usual plots as a form of sensitivity analysis},

The incidence of all symptoms was elevated during seroconversion; however, only fever was associated with faster disease progression. Seven or more days of fever was reported by 13.8\% of subjects; half of them developed AIDS within 6 years, whereas only one-fourth of the men without fever developed AIDS within 6 years. In addition, fever was the only symptom associated with shortened survival and increased CD4 cell loss. Persons experiencing prolonged periods of fever during seroconversion should therefore be considered for early treatment, including prophylaxis against opportunistic infections and combinations of antiretroviral drugs.}

Predictions of long-term mortality (TSFE {\textgreater}or= 40 years) are, however, still untested, because of the limited follow-up of most epidemiological studies. Some authors have suggested that the increase in mesothelioma rate with TSFE might be attenuated by clearance of asbestos from the lungs. We estimated mortality time trends from pleural and peritoneal cancer in a cohort of 3,443 asbestos-cement workers, followed for more than 50 years. The functional relation between mesothelioma rate and TSFE was evaluated with various regression models. The role of asbestos clearance was explored using the traditional mesothelioma multistage model, generalized to include a term representing elimination over time. We observed 139 deaths from pleural and 56 from peritoneal cancer during the period 1950-2003. The rate of pleural cancer increased during the first 40 years of TSFE and reached a plateau thereafter. In contrast, the rate of peritoneal cancer increased monotonically with TSFE. The model allowing for asbestos elimination fitted the data better than the traditional model for pleural (p = 0.02) but not for peritoneal cancer (p = 0.22). The risk for pleural cancer, rather than showing an indefinite increase, might reach a plateau when a sufficiently long time has elapsed since exposure. The different trends for pleural and peritoneal cancer might be related to clearance of the asbestos from the workers' lungs.}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 547 men with elevated prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination but with results negative for prostate cancer on a mean of 9 TRUS guided biopsies was followed through record linkage to the national cancer Registry. The observed number of prostate cancers was compared with the expected number during the same calendar period in an age matched male population to determine the standardized incidence ratio. The sensitivity of TRUS with multiple biopsies after 5 years of followup was calculated. Relative survival was estimated if there was an excess death rate due to undiagnosed prostate cancer. RESULTS: We found 11 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The expected number in the age standardized male population was 15, resulting in a standardized incidence ratio of 0.8 (95\% CI 0.4 to 1.2). Five-year sensitivity of the extended protocol of TRUS guided biopsies was 95.2\% (95\% CI 93.5 to 96.4) and relative survival was more than 100\%, indicating a selection of men deemed candidates for curative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who are examined by an extended protocol of TRUS guided biopsies negative for cancer do not have an increased incidence of prostate cancer within 6 years compared with an age matched male population. Five-year sensitivity of this protocol was high.}

A few years ago, a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, was proposed to enhance the recency of long-term survival estimates. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the use of this method. METHODS: Using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry, we compare 5-year and 10-year relative survival rates of 371 849 patients diagnosed with one of the 16 most common forms of cancer in Finland at various time intervals between 1953 and 1992 with the most up-to-date estimates of 5-year or 10-year relative survival that might have been obtained in those time intervals by traditional methods of survival analysis and by period analysis of survival. RESULTS: Survival rates strongly increased over time for most forms of cancer. For these cancers, traditional estimates of 5- and 10-year survival rates would have severely lagged behind the survival rates later observed for newly diagnosed patients, and period analysis would consistently have provided much more up-to-date estimates of survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that period analysis should be implemented as a standard tool for providing up-to-date estimates of long-term survival rates by cancer registries.}

Estimable functions of the parameters are invariant to the particular constraint applied. For evenly spaced intervals, deviations from linearity are estimable but only a linear function of the three slopes is estimable. When age and period intervals have different widths, further aliasing occurs. It is assumed that the number of deaths in the numerator of the rate equation has a Poisson distribution.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of 2048 HIV-1-positive individuals. SETTING: HIV-1-infected individuals attending 11 of the largest HIV/AIDS units in London. PATIENTS: Subjects were 1056 Africans and 992 non-Africans seen between 1982-1995. RESULTS: There were no differences in crude survival from presentation to death between Africans and non-Africans (median 82 and 78 months, respectively; P = 0.22). Africans progressed more rapidly to AIDS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.21; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.45] but after adjustment for age, sex, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category B symptoms and CD4+ lymphocyte count at presentation, year of HIV diagnosis and hospital attended, this difference was no longer significant (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.43). Africans with AIDS had a reduced risk of death compared with non-Africans (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.96) but not after adjustment for age, CD4+ lymphocyte count at AIDS, initial AIDS-defining conditions (ADC) and hospital attended (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.27). Tuberculosis as the first ADC was associated with a 64\% reduction in the risk of death. CD4+ lymphocyte decline was not significantly different between Africans and non-Africans (P = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in progression to AIDS and death and CD4+ lymphocyte decline between HIV-1-infected Africans and non-Africans in London could not be attributed to ethnicity or different viral subtypes. Age and the clinical and immunological stage at presentation, or AIDS, were the major determinants of outcome. Compared with other diagnoses, tuberculosis as the initial ADC was associated with increased survival. Lack of access to health care and exposure to environmental pathogens are the most likely causes of reduced survival with AIDS in Africa, rather than inherently different rates of progression of immune deficiency due to racial differences or viral subtypes},

Interventions were: (1) an invitation letter; (2) two invitation letters; and (3) an invitation letter plus a follow-up telephone call. METHODS: All women aged 50-54 years in two BreastScreen New South Wales (BSNSW) Screening and Assessment Service catchment areas (n=3,144) were recruited from the Australian Electoral Roll and randomised to the four groups. Response rates for each intervention were compared relative to standard practice (one invitation letter) at 12-weeks follow-up. Marginal cost-effectiveness for each condition was calculated. Other similar randomised trials were also meta-analysed. RESULTS: The screening rate for two letters was 8.5\% (OR=1.61, 95\% CI 1.08-2.40) and 7.8\% (OR=1.46, 95\% CI 0.97-2.18) for one letter plus a telephone call, compared with 5.5\% for standard practice (one letter) (OR=1.00). The response rate in the one letter plus a phone call group was 13.3\% (OR=2.65, 95\% CI 1.76-4.00) for women where a phone number was located. CONCLUSION: Initial screening rates after a 12-week follow-up were significantly higher in the women receiving a second invitation letter, compared with standard practice (one letter). Marginal cost-effectiveness favoured the two-letter approach. IMPLICATIONS: A follow-up invitation letter is more cost-effective than one invitation letter plus a follow-up telephone call in the BSNSW program. However, an invitation letter plus follow-up phone call is more cost-effective in recruiting women to BSNSW only if a phone number is located.}

Lipoatrophy and abdominal distension were observed in protease inhibitor-naive nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) recipients with lactic acidaemia and hepatic impairment, which are known NRTI- induced mitochondrial toxicities. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study in a university-based outpatient clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients studied included 14 NRTI recipients with lipoatrophy, 32 antiretroviral-naive patients without LD, 28 NRTI recipients without LD, 44 combined NRTI-protease inhibitor recipients without LD, and 102 NRTI-protease inhibitor recipients with LD. Data was obtained on body composition (questionnaire, physical examination, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and abdominal computerized tomography), with biochemical, lipid and glycaemic parameters. RESULTS: The NRTI-LD syndrome was characterized by recent onset fatigue and nausea, peripheral lipoatrophy (6 kg loss over 4 months), abdominal distension (ascites +/- hepatomegaly) and elevated lactate (4.6, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7 mmol/l, respectively; P{\textless} 0.0001) and liver enzymes. Cases without hepatic involvement also had lower body fat and greater lactate than unaffected controls. Metabolic disturbances and weight improved after cessation. The NRTI-LD syndrome differed from protease inhibitor- related LD syndrome by the presence of recent onset symptoms and weight loss, higher lactate and alanine aminotransferase, and lower albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin. In treated controls, current stavudine therapy, protease inhibitor duration, and lactic acidaemia were independently associated with both lipoatrophy and abdominal obesity; total NRTI duration was also associated with lipoatrophy, and lamivudine and protease inhibitor duration with buffalo hump. CONCLUSIONS: A syndrome of lipoatrophy, constitutional illness, lactic acidaemia and hepatic dysfunction can complicate NRTI therapy. Both protease inhibitor and NRTI therapies, particularly if associated with lactic acidaemia, contribute to LD syndrome, but have some distinguishable clinical and metabolic effects},

However, protein expression is often heterogeneous resulting in variable degrees and patterns of staining. This problem is particularly acute in prostate cancer, where tumors are infiltrative and heterogeneous in nature. In this article, we introduce analytic approaches that explicitly consider both the frequency and intensity of tissue staining. METHODS: Compositional data analysis is a technique used to analyze vectors of unit-sum proportions, such as those obtained from soil sample studies or species abundance surveys. We summarized specimen staining patterns by the proportion of cells staining at mild, moderate, and intense levels and used compositional data analysis to summarize and compare the resulting staining profiles. RESULTS: In a study of Syndecan-1 staining patterns among 44 localized prostate cancer cases with Gleason score 7 disease, compositional data analysis did not detect a statistically significant difference between the staining patterns in recurrent (n = 22) versus nonrecurrent (n = 22) patients. Results indicated only modest increases in the proportion of cells staining at a moderate intensity in the recurrent group. In contrast, an analysis that compared quantitative scores across groups indicated a (borderline) significant increase in staining in the recurrent group (P = 0.05, t test). CONCLUSIONS: Compositional data analysis offers a novel analytic approach for immunohistochemical studies, providing greater insight into differences in staining patterns between groups, but possibly lower statistical power than existing, score-based methods. When appropriate, we recommend conducting a compositional data analysis in addition to a standard score-based analysis.}

The patients were followed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events and changes in viral load and CD4 cell counts. RESULTS: The decrease in HIV RNA over the first 24 weeks was greater in the three-drug group than in the other groups (P{\textless}0.001 for each comparison). RNA levels decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter at week 24 in 28 of 31 patients in the three-drug group (90 percent), 12 of 28 patients in the indinavir group (43 percent), and none of 30 patients in the zidovudine-lamivudine group. The increase in CD4 cell counts over the first 24 weeks was greater in the two groups receiving indinavir than in the zidovudine-lamivudine group (P{\textless} or =0.01 for each comparison). The changes in the viral load and the CD4 cell count persisted for up to 52 weeks. All the regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In most HIV-infected patients with prior antiretroviral therapy, the combination of indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine reduces levels of HIV RNA to less than 500 copies per milliliter for as long as one year.}

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is one such marker for prostate cancer. This article is concerned with modeling receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves associated with biomarkers at various times prior to the time at which the disease is detected clinically, by two methods. The first models the biomarkers statistically using mixed-effects regression models, and uses parameter estimates from these models to estimate the time-specific ROC curves. The second directly models the ROC curves as a function of time prior to diagnosis and may be implemented using software packages with binary regression or generalized linear model routines. The approaches are applied to data from 71 prostate cancer cases and 71 controls who participated in a lung cancer prevention trial. Two biomarkers for prostate cancer were considered: total serum PSA and the ratio of free to total PSA. Not surprisingly, both markers performed better as the interval between PSA measurement and clinical diagnosis decreased. Although the two markers performed similarly eight years prior to diagnosis, it appears that total PSA performed better than the ratio measure at times closer to diagnosis. The area under the ROC curve was consistently greater for total PSA than for the ratio four and two years prior to diagnosis and at the time of diagnosis.}

METHODS: We developed models using the human capital approach, which relies on earnings as a measure of productivity, to estimate the value of productivity lost as a result of cancer mortality. The base model aggregated age- and sex-specific data from four primary sources: 1) the US Bureau of the Census, 2) US death certificate data for 1999-2003, 3) cohort life tables from the Berkeley Mortality Database for 1900-2000, and 4) the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. In a model that included costs of caregiving and household work, data from the National Human Activity Pattern Survey and the Caregiving in the U.S. study were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed using six types of cancer assuming a 1\% decline in cancer mortality rates. The values of forgone earnings for employed individuals and imputed forgone earnings for informal caregiving were then estimated for the years 2000-2020. RESULTS: The annual productivity cost from cancer mortality in the base model was approximately \$115.8 billion in 2000; the projected value was \$147.6 billion for 2020. Death from lung cancer accounted for more than 27\% of productivity costs. A 1\% annual reduction in lung, colorectal, breast, leukemia, pancreatic, and brain cancer mortality lowered productivity costs by \$814 million per year. Including imputed earnings lost due to caregiving and household activity increased the base model total productivity cost to \$232.4 billion in 2000 and to \$308 billion in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Investments in programs that target the cancers with high incidence and/or cancers that occur in younger, working-age individuals are likely to yield the greatest reductions in productivity losses to society.},

The rate is far higher in males (28.3) than females (3.3). The Western Australian rate (28.9) is the highest among the states, as may be expected because of the crocidolite mine at Wittenoom; however, the largest numbers of cases occur in the more populous and industrial New South Wales. The high incidence rate, its expected continuing increase, and absence of a history of exposure to asbestos in approximately 28\% of cases, demand consideration of potential environmental factors other than asbestos in the causation of this tumor, as well as continued surveillance.}

Data were standardized to facilitate comparison of costs per life year or costs per QALY gained in six studies. Absolute changes in costs, life years and QALYs for each strategy were normalized to a comparison with no screening. Costs were standardized to US\$ in 2000 values. Most models assume screening starts at age 18 or 20 years. Assumed prevalence of HPV ranges from 10\% for those aged 18 years to 20\% for those aged 20-25 years and drops substantially after age 30. All except one model assume sensitivity to LSIL of 83\% or higher. Two models distinguish the increasing specificity of HPV testing in older age groups (up to 95\% for LSIL in women aged 55 years or older). All the models include consultation costs as well as screening and treatment costs, but costs for follow-up diagnosis and treatment vary considerably. Two models also include patient time costs. Despite these differences all strategies involving HPV testing have cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ratios in the range of USD 12,400-16,600. Costs per life year vary more widely, the highest being USD 19,246 (annual screening with liquid cytology and HPV). However, excluding strategies using liquid cytology, the highest costs per life year for a strategy including HPV testing are under USD 14,000 (simultaneous conventional cytology and HPV every two years). The cost per life year for HPV testing alone triennially is lower than for Pap smear testing alone biennially. Costs per QALY are generally lower than costs per life year (given the reported modelling assumptions and settings). Even with inclusion of patient costs, no strategies involving HPV testing cost more than USD 16,600 per QALY. Adoption of the ACOG guidelines to include HPV testing with cytology as a screening option for women aged 30 years or older therefore appears to be cost-effective.}

Despite increases in women's labour force participation, gender differences in work-related health conditions have received little research attention. This appears be the first study to examine why employed women are much more likely than men to experience upper body musculoskeletal disorders.A mailed self-report survey gathered data from 737 Australian Public Service employees (73\% women). The majority of respondents were clerical workers (73\%). Eighty one per cent reported some upper body symptoms; of these, 20\% reported severe and continuous upper body pain. Upper body musculoskeletal symptoms were more prevalent and more severe among women. The gender difference in symptom severity was explained by risk factors at work (repetitive work, poor ergonomic equipment), and at home (having less opportunity to relax and exercise outside of work). Parenthood exacerbated this gender difference, with mothers reporting the least time to relax or exercise. There was no suggestion that women were more vulnerable than men to pain, nor was there evidence of systematic confounding between perceptions of work conditions and reported health status.Changes in the nature of work mean that more and more employees, especially women, use computers for significant parts of their workday. The sex-segregation of women into sedentary, repetitive and routine work, and the persisting gender imbalance in domestic work are interlinking factors that explain gender differences in musculoskeletal disorders.

METHODS: The study was conducted at 148 clinical centers during Prostate Cancer Awareness Week in September 1993 and continued through June 1994. A total of 31,953 eligible subjects were tested by both digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA was tested with the Abbott IMx PSA assay and reported by Roche Biomedical, Inc. RESULTS: The study confirmed that elevated PSA levels (greater than 4.0 ng/mL) aid in the detection of organ-confined prostate cancer when used in conjunction with the DRE. Reflecting more conservative biopsy decision-making practices, study results nonetheless are comparable to earlier reports. Among 1307 subjects who underwent biopsy, 322 cancers were detected. The cancer detection rate was 3.6\% for PSA, 3.0\% for DRE, and 4.7\% if either test result was positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) for elevated PSA levels (greater than 4.0 ng/mL) was 3l.6\%, significantly better (P {\textless} 0.0001) than the PPV for abnormal DRE results (25.5\%). Nearly 90\% (88.9\%) of staged cancers were diagnosed as localized. Elevated PSA levels detected more localized cancers (76 of 105 [72.4\%]) than the DRE (72 of 105 [68.6\%]). Of localized tumors, 33 (31.4\%) were missed by DRE and detected solely by PSA, and 29 (27.6\%) were missed by PSA and detected solely by DRE. The combined use of the two methods detected 33 additional localized tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Community practice throughout the United States demonstrates that PSA and DRE are consistently effective and efficient in the early detection of prostate cancer.}

This study addresses the question of whether testing women who have low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) of the uterine cervix for HPV DNA is useful as a triage strategy. METHODS: Four clinical centers in different areas of the United States participated in a randomized clinical trial of the use of HPV DNA testing in women with cytologic evidence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or LSIL. The study sample in this article consists only of women who had LSIL at enrollment. Within 6 months of an LSIL diagnosis (based on a Pap smear read by a community-based cytopathologist), women who were 18 years of age or older completed a standardized questionnaire and underwent a pelvic examination that included collection of cervical specimens for HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture II (HCII)(R) assay. RESULTS: Among the 642 women referred with LSIL who had analyzable test results, the mean chronologic age and age at first coitus were similar among the four clinical centers, despite the centers' ethnic and geographic diversity. Overall, HPV DNA was detected in cervical samples from 532 (82.9\%) of the 642 women (95\% confidence interval = 79.7\%-85.7\%). This high frequency of HPV positivity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in a subset of 210 paired specimens tested by HCII and PCR (81.4\% were positive by both methods). CONCLUSION: Because a very high percentage of women with an LSIL diagnosis from Pap smears are positive for HPV DNA by HCII testing, there is limited potential for this assay to direct decisions about the clinical management of women with LSIL. The role of HPV testing in the management of women with ASCUS is still under study.}

This paper describes the design and methodological components of the Sentinel Site for Obesity Prevention, a demonstration site in the Barwon-South West region of Victoria, Australia, that aims to build the programs, skills and evidence necessary to attenuate and eventually reverse the obesity epidemic in children and adolescents. The Sentinel Site for Obesity Prevention is based on a partnership between the region's university (Deakin University) and its health, education and local government agencies. The three basic foundations of the Sentinel Site are: multi-strategy, multi-setting interventions; building community capacity; and undertaking program evaluations and population monitoring. Three intervention projects have been supported that cover different age groups (preschool: 2-5 years, primary school: 5-12 years, secondary school: 13-17 years), but that have many characteristics in common including: community participation and ownership of the project; an intervention duration of at least 3 years; and full evaluations with impact (behaviours) and outcome measures (anthropometry) compared with regionally representative comparison populations. We recommend the Sentinel Site approach to others for successfully building evidence for childhood obesity prevention and stimulating action on reducing the epidemic.}

OBJECTIVE: To determine the reproducibility of cytologic, colposcopic histologic, and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) histologic cervical specimen interpretations among multiple well-trained observers. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance-Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (ASCUS-LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), an ongoing US multicenter clinical trial. SUBJECTS: From women enrolled in ALTS during 1996-1998, 4948 monolayer cytologic slides, 2237 colposcopic biopsies, and 535 LEEP specimens were interpreted by 7 clinical center and 4 Pathology Quality Control Group (QC) pathologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: kappa Values calculated for comparison of the original clinical center interpretation and the first QC reviewer's masked interpretation of specimens. RESULTS: For all 3 specimen types, the clinical center pathologists rendered significantly more severe interpretations than did reviewing QC pathologists. The reproducibility of monolayer cytologic interpretations was moderate (kappa = 0.46; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.48) and equivalent to the reproducibility of punch biopsy histopathologic interpretations (kappa = 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.49) and LEEP histopathologic interpretations (kappa = 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.55). The lack of reproducibility of histopathology was most evident for less severe interpretations. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretive variability is substantial for all types of cervical specimens. Histopathology of cervical biopsies is not more reproducible than monolayer cytology, and even the interpretation of LEEP results is variable. Given the degree of irreproducibility that exists among well-trained pathologists, realistic performance expectations should guide use of their interpretations.}

One potential explanation is that follow-up of abnormal tests is suboptimal, and the benefits of screening are not being realized. The authors used a conceptual model of access to care and integrated constructs from models of provider and patient health behaviors to review published literature on follow-up care. Most studies reported that fewer than 75 percent of patients received some follow-up care, indicating that the promise of screening may be compromised. They identified pervasive barriers to follow-up at the provider, patient, and health care system levels. Interventions that address these barriers appear to be effective. Improvement of data infrastructure and reporting will be important objectives for policy makers, and further use of conceptual models by researchers may improve intervention development and, ultimately, cancer control.}

METHOD: Follow-up of patients randomized to stop or continue PI-based therapy for 24 weeks, in a multicenter study, was continued for up to 120 weeks. Biochemistry and lipid parameters were assessed every 3 months. DEXA and CT scans were performed annually. Limb fat, visceral adipose tissue, and the lipodystrophy case definition score (LCDS) were used as indicators of LD severity. RESULTS: Forty-five male patients with baseline and week 120 body composition data were assessed. There were no significant changes in the limb fat or visceral adipose tissue (VAT) components of LD, with the exception of the LCDS (change from baseline +5.79, p {\textless} .001). Control of viral replication was maintained and lipid and glycemic parameters were unchanged over the 120-week follow-up. Linear regression analysis showed on-study usage of stavudine was independently and significantly correlated with both decreased limb fat mass and a higher LCDS. CONCLUSION: Body composition or metabolic features of LD did not improve over 2 years of observation in patients remaining on predominantly PI-sparing therapy. LD was adversely influenced by continued stavudine use.}

The aim of this study was to empirically assess the validity of these commonly reported standard errors. Using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry, the authors calculated 5- and 10-year absolute, expected, and relative survival rates for patients with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989. The authors used bootstrap analysis to empirically assess the random error of absolute and relative survival rates and then compared the results with conventionally derived estimates of standard errors. The conventional and bootstrap standard errors were closely similar for all estimates of absolute survival. By contrast, the conventional estimates of standard errors of 5- and 10-year relative survival exceeded the bootstrap estimates by up to 17\% and 32\%, respectively. The authors conclude that conventional derivation may substantially overestimate standard errors for relative survival.}

In developing countries, cancer of the cervix uteri ranks first, breast cancer second. The second most frequent cause of death from cancer in both sexes is cancer of the stomach, followed by liver cancer in men and by colon/rectum cancer in women. Cancers of the colon/rectum and prostate maintain a high rank in men living in developed countries, while cancers of the lung, ovary and pancreas occupy similar ranks among women. In developing countries, cancers of the oesophagus and mouth/pharynx follow those previously mentioned in both sexes. If the estimated rates continue to prevail, increases in the numbers of deaths of 20.4\% in developed and 18.1\% in developing countries are expected by the year 2000, simply as a consequence of demographic trends towards ageing and population growth. Our results provide an indication of the potential impact of preventive practices. It is estimated that 20\% of all cancer deaths (1 million) could be prevented by eliminating tobacco smoking. Mortality from cancers of the liver and uterine cervix, both major problems in developing countries, could be substantially reduced by immunization against hepatitis B virus infection and early detection through Pap smears, respectively.}

	annote = {Evaluation of osteoporotic vertebral fracture risk is currently based on measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), but bone strength depends also on bone quality parameters. Aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of a new vertebral morphometric index, the Anterior Vertebral Heights sum (AHs) in discriminating women at high risk of vertebral fracture, comparing its diagnostic accuracy with that of BMD measured at lumbar spine (LS-BMD) and femoral neck (FN-BMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 163 Caucasian post-menopausal women (age range 46-74 years, mean age+/-SD=63.8+/-7.1 years), who did not present prevalent fractures at baseline evaluation, were observed at longitudinal follow-up. X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine, LS-BMD and FN-BMD measurements were obtained in all patients at baseline and repeated at the second follow-up visit 18-24 months later (mean 21+/-1.7 months). Radiographs of spine were analysed in order to identify vertebral fractures using a visual semiquantitative method (SQ) and vertebral morphometry as well as by calculating the AHs morphometric index. RESULTS: During follow-up, 21/163 patients (12.9\%) sustained a new vertebral fracture; 95.2\% (20/21) of fractured patients but only 4.9\% (7/142) of non-fractured women had reduced AHs values. As regarding BMD, 66.6\% (14/21) and 61.9\% (13/21) of women with incident fracture were osteoporotic at lumbar spine and femoral neck baseline evaluation , whereas among non-fractured women, 38\% (54/142) at LS-BMD and 33.1\% (47/142) at FN-BMD were osteoporotic . Analyses of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed that AHs discriminated vertebral fractures almost perfectly (AUC 0.97; 95\% CI 0.95-0.99). On the other hand, the AUC for LS-BMD was only 0.73 (95\% CI 0.64-0.81) and for FN-BMD was 0.72 (95\%CI 0.63-0.80), showing that the diagnostic accuracy of AHs was significantly higher compared to that of LS-BMD (p{\textless}0.001) or FN-BMD (p{\textless}0.001). A modified Poisson regression model for binary data was used to assess the independent role of AHs in predicting vertebral fracture. The effect of AHs remained statistically significant (p{\textless}0.001) after adjusting by FN-BMD, age, weight and body height. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate the validity of this new morphometric index in evaluating the risk of osteoporotic vertebral fractures thus suggesting that AHs should be considered a valid parameter in clinical practice to assess the need for primary prevention of vertebral fractures.}

	abstract = {Time trends for population-based disease rates often are summarized by using direct adjustment by period of diagnosis or death. Similarly, the effect of age often is presented graphically as age-specific rates for a given period of diagnosis. These approaches may be necessary if there is an absence of long-term data, as they provide a natural way for annually updating information when monitoring trends, or they may be a convenient way of summarizing a large amount of data (7, 10, 11, 39, 45). However, these summaries only can adjust for the effect of age in a given period; they implicitly ignore the cohort effect. The effect of cohort is an important factor in understanding time trends for many diseases. Thus, it is not advisable to use data analytic strategies that routinely ignore it. Another alternative to modeling is to give a graphical presentation of the age-specific rates themselves. As I noted in the introduction, some of the first analyses to identify the effect of cohort on diseases, such as tuberculosis and lung cancer, relied entirely on a graphical analysis. Although graphs certainly are an important part of the interpretation of time trends, it would be a mistake to limit your analysis to impressions of points on a graph. For example, such a perusal would not give an objective indication of the statistical significance of a particular pattern. Regression analysis forces us to recognize a fundamental problem with interpreting time trends in disease rates--a problem that you should remember, even when trying to understand a graphical display of time trends in age-specific rates.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 20 cohorts in Europe and Australia were used Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE). Analysis was restricted to persons seroconverting in 1988-1998 who started antiretroviral treatment in the first 3 months or 1-2 years from seroconversion. The relationship between times to low CD4 count, AIDS and death and time of initiation of treatment was estimated using proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Seroconversion illness was more common in those who began antiretroviral treatment in the first 3 months (73\%) than in those who started treatment within 1-2 years post-seroconversion (33\%). Subjects receiving early antiretroviral treatment had times to AIDS and to CD4 counts {\textless}200 cells/microL that were intermediate between those of subjects starting treatment within 1-2 years and those of the subset of these subjects starting treatment within 1-2 years who also had a prior CD4 count of {\textgreater}350 cells/microL and no prior AIDS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these analyses, the effect of antiretroviral treatment initiation during HIV seroconversion is uncertain. It may result in lower rates of progression compared with starting antiretroviral treatment at 1-2 years, but the early antiretroviral treatment group had a similar or even higher incidence of low CD4 counts and AIDS events than the group who started antiretroviral treatment within 1-2 years with CD4 counts over 350 cells/microL and no prior AIDS diagnosis. Estimates of the effect of early treatment are probably confounded with a number of factors, including, in particular, reasons for treatment initiation.}

One way to estimate prevalence is via population-based registries, where data on diagnosis and life status of all incidence cases occurring in the covered population are collected. In this paper, a method to estimate the complete prevalence and its variance from population-based registries is presented. In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the complete prevalence, its calculation can be thought as made by three steps. Step 1 counts the incidence cases diagnosed during the period of registration and still alive. Step 2 estimates the expected number of survivors among cases lost to follow-up. Step 3 estimates the complete prevalence by taking into account cases diagnosed before the start of registration. The combination of steps 1+2 is defined as the counting method, to estimate the limited duration prevalence; step 3 is the completeness index method, to estimate the complete prevalence. For early established registries, steps 1+2 are more important than step 3, because observation time is long enough to include all past diagnosed cases still alive in the prevalence data. For more recently established registries, step 3 is by far the most critical because a large part of prevalence might have been diagnosed before the period of registration (Corazziari I, Mariotto A, Capocaccia R. Correcting the completeness bias of observed prevalence. Tumori 1999; 85: 370-81). The work by Clegg LX, Gail MH, Feuer EJ. Estimating the variance of disease-prevalence estimates from population-based registries. Biometrics 2002; 55: 1137-44. considers the problem of the variability of the estimated prevalence up to step 2. To our knowledge, no other work has considered the variability induced by correcting for the unobserved cases diagnosed before the period of registration, crucial to estimate the prevalence in recent registries. An analytic approach is considered to calculate the variance of step 3. A unified expression for the variance of the prevalence allowing for steps 1 through 3 is obtained. Some applications to cancer data are presented.}

Outcomes assessed were hospital admission and disease progression (either a new AIDS diagnosis or death) after starting HAART. Hazard ratios (HRs) derived using Cox regression methods compared female-to-male rates, adjusting for other factors independently associated with outcome. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-seven men and 146 women were followed up over a median of 13 months after starting HAART. Eighty-one percent of men were white, and 75\% were homosexual. Fifty-eight percent of women were black African, and 86\% were in the heterosexual risk category. The baseline CD4 count was higher in men than in women (191 vs. 145 x 10; p {\textless} .01), but viral loads were similar (5.2 vs. 5.1 log copies/ml, respectively; p = .13). Fifty-six percent of men and women were treatment naive. Eighteen percent of men and women were admitted during follow-up, with 17\% of male admissions and 12\% of female admissions being the result of an AIDS-defining illness. The HR for admission was 0.76 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-1.27; p = .30) for women relative to men. Eleven percent of the men and 8\% of the women experienced progression. Eighty-eight percent of progressions were the result of a new AIDS diagnosis (46 in men, 11 in women), and 8 men died. The HR for progression was 0.70 (CI: 0.36-1.33; p = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible benefit in women compared with men in the rate of outcomes after HAART. Further analysis with longer follow-up or greater numbers would enable a more powerful analysis to be performed},

STUDY DESIGN: A 2-year prospective follow-up of 1539 women was designed to assess the percentage sensitivity of different postcolposcopy management strategies to detect subsequent CIN grade 2 or 3 and percentage referral to repeat colposcopy. RESULTS: HPV testing at 12 months was sensitive (92.2\%) for detection of CIN grade 2 or 3 with a referral rate to repeat colposcopy of 55.0\%. Repeat semiannual cytology with referral to colposcopy at an ASCUS threshold demonstrated similar sensitivity (88.0\%) but with a higher rate of referral to colposcopy (63.6\%). Combining cytology and HPV testing did not increase sensitivity and hurt specificity. Baseline viral load and colposcopic impression were not helpful. CONCLUSION: The most efficient test for identifying women with CIN grade 2 or 3 after colposcopy might be an HPV test alone at 12 months.}

In contrast with matching in epidemiologic etiology studies, matching in the classification setting has not been rigorously studied. In this article, we consider the implications of matching in terms of the choice of statistical analysis, efficiency, and assessment of the incremental value of the marker over the matching covariates. We find that adjustment for the matching covariates is essential, as unadjusted summaries of classification accuracy can be biased. In many settings, matching is the most efficient covariate-dependent sampling scheme, and we provide an expression for the optimal matching ratio. However, we also show that matching greatly complicates estimation of the incremental value of the marker. We recommend that matching be carefully considered in the context of these findings.},

METHODS: A systematic search for randomised controlled trials was conducted through electronic scientific databases and a specialist register of the Cochrane Prostatic Diseases and Urologic Cancers Group. Manual searching of specific journals was also conducted. Two authors independently reviewed studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were independently assessed for quality. Data from included studies was also extracted independently. RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials were included however, both trials had methodological weaknesses. Re-analysis of the reported data using intention-to-screen and meta-analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between men randomized for prostate cancer screening and controls (RR 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.80-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: Given that only two randomised controlled trials were included, and the high risk of bias of both trials, there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of screening compared to no screening for reducing prostate cancer mortality. Currently, no robust evidence from randomised controlled trials is available regarding the impact of screening on quality of life, harms of screening, or its economic value. Results from two ongoing large scale multi-center randomised controlled trials, which will be available in the upcoming few years, will assist patients and health professionals in making an evidence-based decision regarding the effectiveness of screening for prostate cancer.}

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.
METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial. Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns. The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening. A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry. We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.
RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up. Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 \% to 15-28 \%, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 \% to 9-25 \%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit. While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.},

This analysis assesses the relationship between parity and breast cancer risk: the relative importance of age at first birth, age at subsequent births and total parity. We also evaluate whether a dual effect of an increased risk immediately after childbirth followed by a long-term benefit exists. Three logistic regression models were used. Age at first delivery is an important breast cancer risk factor: among parous women it was associated with a 5.3\% increase/year in the odds of breast cancer. Multiparity was not shown to be an independent risk factor. Age at subsequent deliveries was associated with a 1\% increase in risk for every 1 year increase of age at any birth, but this contribution to the risk was not significant. In the analysis stratified by parity the most important influence is with the age at first birth. We find no evidence of an effect on the odds of breast cancer associated with the age at the second, or later, births. We do find that there is an increased risk associated with the birth of the first child followed by a longer term protective effect. A post-menopausal woman has a reduced breast cancer risk compared with a pre-menopausal woman of the same age, adjusting for the same number of deliveries and ages at these deliveries.}

We will focus on the difficulty of finding a weakly informative prior for the Poisson parameters: different priors will be detailed and compared. Then, the performances of different moves created for changing dimension will be investigated. The model is extended by the introduction of covariates, with homogeneous or heterogeneous effect.

METHODS: For 2 years (October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1993) data were collected by community child health nurses on all infants born in New Zealand at initial contact and at 2 months. RESULTS: There were 232 SIDS cases in the postneonatal age group (2.0/1000 live births) and these were compared with 1200 randomly selected control subjects. Information was available for 127 cases (54.7\%) and 922 (76.8\%) of controls. The previously identified modifiable risk factors were examined. The prevalence of prone sleeping position of the infant was very low (0.7\% at initial contact and 3. 0\% at 2 months), but was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS. In addition, the side sleeping position was also found to have an increased risk of SIDS compared with the supine sleeping position (at 2 months: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.57; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71, 25.23). Maternal smoking was found to be the major risk factor for SIDS. Bed sharing was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and bed sharing on the risk of SIDS. Compared with infants not exposed to either bed sharing or maternal smoking, the adjusted OR for infants of mothers who smoked was 5.01 (95\% CI = 2.01, 12.46) for bed sharing at the initial contact and 5.02 (95\% CI = 1.05, 24. 05) for bed sharing at 2 months. In this study breastfeeding was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of SIDS. The other risk factors for SIDS identified were: unmarried mother, leaving school at a younger age, young mother, greater number of previous pregnancies, late attendance for antenatal care, smoking in pregnancy, male infant, Maori ethnicity, low birth weight, and shorter gestation. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for potential confounders, prone and side sleeping positions, maternal smoking, and the joint exposure to bed sharing and maternal smoking were associated with statistically significant increased risk of SIDS. A change from the side to the supine sleeping position could result in a substantial reduction in SIDS. Maternal smoking is common in New Zealand and with the reduction in the prevalence of prone sleeping position is now the major risk factor in this country. However, smoking behavior has been difficult to change. Bed sharing is also a major factor but appears only to be a risk to infants of mothers who smoke. Addressing bed sharing among mothers who smoke could reduce SIDS by at least one third. Breastfeeding did not appear to offer a statistically significant reduction in SIDS risk after adjustment of potential confounders, but as breastfeeding rates are comparatively good in New Zealand, this result should be interpreted with caution as the power of this study to detect a benefit is small.}

The question raised is whether this present evidence is sufficient for making firm recommendations on HPV screening. A validated cervical cancer screening model was extended by adding HPV infection as a possible precursor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Two widely different model quantifications were constructed so that both were compatible with the observed HPV risk ratios. One model assumed a much longer duration of HPV infection before progressing to CIN and a higher sensitivity of the HPV test than the other. In one version of the model, the calculated mortality reduction from HPV screening was higher and the (cost-)effectiveness was much better than for Pap smear screening. In the other version, outcomes were the opposite, although the cost-effectiveness of the combined HPV + cytology test was close to that of Pap smear screening. Although small follow-up studies and studies with limited strength of design suggest that HPV testing may well improve cervical cancer screening, only large longitudinal screening studies on the association between HPV infection and the development of neoplasias can give outcomes that would enable a firm conclusion to be made on the (cost-)effectiveness of HPV screening. Prospective studies should address women aged 30-60 years.}

Prostate cancer lifetime risk estimates are particularly influenced by improved mortality rates and increased detection of asymptomatic disease. In this study, we report trends in lifetime risk estimates of developing prostate cancer in white and black men in the United States, from 1975 to 1993, and focus on the effects of changing mortality and screening. For the study period 1975-1977 to 1991-1993, the lifetime risk of developing invasive prostate cancer increased from 7.3 to 19.6\% for whites and from 8.5 to 18.6\% for blacks. When we recalculated these estimates using age-specific incidence trends from 1975 through 1989 (thereby controlling for the effect of prostate-specific antigen serum testing on prostate cancer incidence rates), the lifetime risk estimates in 1991-1993 fell to 13.8\% for whites and 12.5\% for blacks. When we made an additional assumption, basing lifetime risk estimates on higher 1975-1977 mortality rates, the lifetime risk estimates in 1991-1993 became 11.3\% for whites and 11.8\% for blacks. It is also shown that although mortality rates have improved for white and black men over the study period, they are much larger for blacks than whites in younger age groups, when the prevalence of prostate cancer is relatively low. As a result, fewer blacks survive to older ages when age-specific prostate cancer rates are large. It is of note that blacks have higher incidence rates for prostate cancer than do whites at every age-specific interval. Hence, increasing trends in lifetime risk of prostate cancer suggest, in large part, longer life expectancy and better detection methods.}

The purpose of the current study was to estimate the impact of endoscopic surveillance on colorectal cancer-specific survival for persons with localized or regional colorectal cancer. The population included Medicare patients (age {\textgreater}or=65 years) who were diagnosed with local or regional stage colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1996. METHODS: The current study was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as those individuals who died of colorectal cancer and controls were defined as those with colorectal cancer who did not die of colorectal cancer; controls were frequency matched to cases. Surveillance was defined as the use of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema {\textgreater}or=6 months after diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to control for endoscopic procedure, race, comorbidity index at the time of diagnosis, and types of initial treatments after surgery. RESULTS: The analysis group contained 8130 cases (29\%) and 20,079 controls (71\%). The average time to first bowel surveillance for those with at least 1 surveillance examination was 15.9 months after the diagnosis (median, 13 months). In the regression analysis, surveillance endoscopy was not found to be associated with improved colorectal cancer-specific survival (odds ratio of 1.01; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95-1.06 [P=0.85]). Setting the surveillance interval to 12 months and 15 months rather than 6 months after diagnosis did not appear to influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance endoscopy does not appear to influence colorectal cancer-specific mortality in patients age {\textgreater}65 years who are diagnosed with localized or regional stage colorectal cancer.}

DESIGN: Cohort of recently infected haemophiliacs with relatively high CD4 lymphocyte counts followed for up to 8.5 years from baseline measurement of CD8 lymphocyte counts and IgA levels. SETTING: A regional haemophilia centre based in a major teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty-four of 111 patients with haemophilia who seroconverted to HIV between 1979 and 1985 in whom CD8 lymphocyte counts and IgA levels were measured soon after seroconversion (mean, 2.7 years; maximum, 5 years) while CD4 lymphocyte counts remained relatively high (median, 600 x 10(6)/l; minimum, 300 x 10(6)/l). OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of severe immunodeficiency defined by a CD4 lymphocyte count falling below 50 x 10(6)/l, and AIDS. RESULTS: Individuals with high CD8 counts (P {\textless} 0.008) and high IgA levels (P {\textless} 0.003) at baseline experienced a more rapid rate of CD4 lymphocyte loss than those with low baseline levels. A score was derived to combine the predictive ability of CD8 count and IgA level. Estimated proportions with CD4 counts below 50 x 10(6)/l after 8 years of follow-up were 100, 30 and 14\% for those with high, intermediate and low baseline scores, respectively. The CD8/IgA score showed similar ability to predict the future occurrence of AIDS (P {\textless} 0.0001; log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Immune activation seen in HIV infection, as reflected by raised CD8 counts and IgA levels, appears to be linked to the process of CD4 lymphocyte depletion. Measurement of these markers in the years following infection, when CD4 lymphocyte counts remain high, provides a first indication of a patient's long-term prognosis},

To evaluate this strategy, we infected rhesus macaques with the pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus RT-SHIV and treated them with the antiretroviral drug (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA) for 8 weeks starting 7 or 14 days postinfection. PMPA treatment suppressed viral replication efficiently in all of the monkeys. After chemotherapy ended, virus replication rebounded and viral RNA in plasma reached levels comparable to that of the controls in four of the six monkeys. However, in the other two animals, virus loads peaked only moderately after withdrawal of the drug and then declined to low or even undetectable levels. These low levels of viremia remained stable for at least 31 weeks after cessation of therapy. At this time point, these two monkeys were challenged with SIV(8980) to evaluate whether the host responses which were able to keep RT-SHIV replication under control were also sufficient to protect against infection with a highly pathogenic heterologous virus. Both monkeys proved to be protected against the heterologous virus. In one of the two animals, low levels of SIV(8980) replication were detected. Thus, by chemotherapy during the acute phase of pathogenic virus replication, we could achieve not only persistent virus load suppression in two out of six monkeys but also protection from subsequent heterologous challenge. By this chemotherapeutic attenuation, the replication kinetics of attenuated viruses could be mimicked and a vaccination effect similar to that induced by live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccines was achieved.}

This article examines the credibility and policy implications of the "amphibole hypothesis," which postulates that (1) the mesotheliomas observed among workers exposed to chrysotile asbestos may be explained by confounding exposures to amphiboles, and (2) chrysotile may have lower carcinogenic potency than amphiboles. METHODS. A critical review was conducted of the lung burden, epidemiologic, toxicologic, and mechanistic studies that provide the basis for the amphibole hypothesis. RESULTS. Mechanistic and lung burden studies do not provide convincing evidence for the amphibole hypothesis. Toxicologic and epidemiologic studies provide strong evidence that chrysotile is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma. Chrysotile may be less potent than some amphiboles for inducing mesotheliomas, but there is little evidence to indicate lower lung cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS. Given the evidence of a significant lung cancer risk, the lack of conclusive evidence for the amphibole hypothesis, and the fact that workers are generally exposed to a mixture of fibers, we conclude that it is prudent to treat chrysotile with virtually the same level of concern as the amphibole forms of asbestos.}

We find that increased fertility is linked to increased rather than decreased postreproductive survival. Postreproductive life expectancy extension is found to be tied to late births. This finding sheds new light on the cost of reproduction and may be viewed as supporting a new paradigm that states that reproductive potential drives remaining longevity. The emerging reproductive potential concept complements the well-established cost of reproduction hypothesis. Alternative explanations for the observed association are also explored. A specific finding is that the degree to which mortality increases for 50-year-old mothers as a result of senescence is closely tied to the logarithm of the age of their youngest child. For example, 50-year-old mothers experience a mortality decrease of 38\% and an increase of remaining lifetime of 3.93 years for every 10-fold decrease in the age of their youngest child. This amount of gain in remaining life expectancy would apply to a mother with a two-year-old child as compared with a mother with a 20-year-old offspring. We also find evidence for the existence of vulnerable periods in human life history that are characterized by phases of heightened mortality and are found to be tied to reproduction and senescence.}

For men, there were 642 SIRs, of which 138 (21\%) had a P {\textless} 0.05 (13\% positive with SIR {\textgreater} 1.0 and 8\% negative with SIR {\textless} or = 1.0) when testing the null hypothesis of no cancer/occupation association; some of these were probably due to confounding by nonoccupational risk factors (e.g., smoking). After EB adjustments, there were 95 (15\%) SIRs with P {\textless} 0.05 (10\% positive and 5\% negative). For women, there were 373 SIRs, of which 37 (10\%) had P {\textless} 0.05 before adjustment (6\% positive and 4\% negative) and 13 (3\%) had P {\textless} 0.05 after adjustment (2\% positive and 1\% negative). Several known associations were confirmed after EB adjustment (e.g., pleural cancer among plumbers, original SIR 3.2 (95\% confidence interval, 2.5-4.1), adjusted SIR 2.0 (95\% confidence interval, 1.6-2.4). EB can produce more accurate estimates of relative risk by shrinking imprecise outliers toward the mean, which may reduce the number of false positives otherwise flagged for further investigation. For example, liver cancer among chimney sweepers was reduced from an original SIR of 2.2 (range, 1.1-4.4) to an adjusted SIR of 1.1 (range, 0.9-1.4). A potentially important future application for EB is studies of gene-environment-disease interactions, in which hundreds of polymorphisms may be evaluated with dozens of environmental risk factors in large cohort studies, producing thousands of associations.}

METHODS: A mathematical model of HIV transmission in homosexual men was developed, based on the HIV epidemic in Australia in 1996, when effective antiretroviral treatments first became widely available. Uncertainties in parameters were modelled using 1000 simulations. The effect of treatments on decreasing infectiousness was randomly sampled with a median 10-fold decrease in infectiousness (range 100-fold to no decrease). Levels of unsafe sex were randomly sampled with a median 50\% increase in unsafe sex (range 100\% to no increase). The percentage change in HIV incidence after one year was obtained by comparison with a null model in which there was no decrease in infectiousness as a result of treatment and no change in unsafe sex. RESULTS: Results of the models suggested that whereas increased levels of unsafe sex were linearly associated with increases in HIV incidence, decreases in infectiousness because of treatments were non-linearly associated with decreases in HIV incidence. An assessment of the competing effects suggested that decreases in infectiousness of two-, five-, and 10-fold would be counterbalanced by increases in unsafe sex of approximately 40, 60 and 70\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These models suggest that apparently large decreases in infectiousness as a result of treatment could be counterbalanced in terms of new HIV infections by much more modest increases in unsafe sex},

Some 72.6\% of these participants gave consent for information on their use of GP services over a 12-month period to be obtained from national insurance records. We found that self-employed men and women reported more decision authority than the organizationally employed, while self-employed women also had more manageable job demands. Self-employment offered men no health benefit. However, women who were self-employed reported worse physical health than their organizationally employed counterparts. While work stress factors were most likely to be associated with the use of GP services by self-employed men, the use of those services by women was more strongly associated with their experiences of stress in organizational employment. Overall, self-employment was found to be associated with relatively few mental health benefits.}

For a BMI difference of 8 kg per m2, that is, the difference between a thin person and someone who is morbidly obese, the random effects estimate of the rate ratio from the four cohort studies was 0.70 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.91], and the random effects estimate of the odds ratio from the 19 case-control studies was 0.88 (95\% CI = 0.76-1.02). Because of substantial heterogeneity among the study-specific estimates, however, we also examined the influence of certain aspects of study design. Case-control studies with community controls had a more inverse association, whereas case-control studies that interviewed cases shortly after diagnosis applied the same exclusion criteria to cases and controls, or with confounder adjustment beyond age had a more positive association between BMI and breast cancer. Possible reasons for the discrepancies among the case-control studies are discussed.}

In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4\% and CD8\% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values less than 25\% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean +/- s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1.90 +/- 0.55, 1.45 +/- 0.46, 0.83 +/- 0.29 and 0.56 +/- 0.23 x 10(9)/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27\% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4 less than 0.4 x 10(9)/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were 'physiologically' lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations 'within persons' were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60\% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts less than 0.4 x 10(9)/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1.4\% and 3\%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show less than 0.4 x 10(9)/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency}

Quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this problem are, however, lacking. We estimated rates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis due to PSA testing that are consistent with the observed incidence of prostate cancer in the United States from 1988 through 1998. Overdiagnosis was defined as the detection of prostate cancer through PSA testing that otherwise would not have been diagnosed within the patient's lifetime. METHODS: We developed a computer simulation model of PSA testing and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis and death from prostate cancer among a hypothetical cohort of two million men who were 60-84 years old in 1988. Given values for the expected lead time--that is, the time by which the test advanced diagnosis--and the expected incidence of prostate cancer in the absence of PSA testing, the model projected the increase in population incidence of prostate cancer associated with PSA testing. By comparing the model-projected incidence with the observed incidence derived from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data, we determined the lead times and corresponding overdiagnosis rates that were consistent with the observed data. RESULTS: SEER data on prostate cancer incidence from 1988 through 1998 were consistent with overdiagnosis rates of approximately 29\% for whites and 44\% for blacks among men with prostate cancers detected by PSA screening. CONCLUSIONS: Among men with prostate cancer that would be detected only at autopsy, these rates correspond to overdiagnosis rates of, at most, 15\% in whites and 37\% in blacks. The observed trends in prostate cancer incidence are consistent with considerable overdiagnosis among PSA-detected cases. However, the results suggest that the majority of screen-detected cancers diagnosed between 1988 and 1998 would have presented clinically and that only a minority of cases found at autopsy would have been detected by PSA testing.}

In the spirit of adaptive LASSO, twin boosting is also incorporated to fit more sparse models. The proposed methods have a unified approach to fit linear models, non-linear effects models with possible interactions. The methods can perform variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched PubMed (June 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Seven completed and eligible trials involving half a million women were identified. We excluded a biased trial from analysis. Two trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, relative risk (RR) 0.93 (95\% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.09) at 13 years; four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, RR 0.75 (0.67 to 0.83) (P = 0.02 for difference between the two estimates). RR for all six trials combined was 0.80 (0.73 to 0.88). The two trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, RR 1.02 (0.95 to 1.10) after 10 years, or on all-cause mortality, RR 1.00 (0.96 to 1.04) after 13 years. We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups, RR 1.31 (1.22 to 1.42) for the two adequately randomised trials; the use of radiotherapy was similarly increased. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Screening likely reduces breast cancer mortality. Based on all trials, the reduction is 20\%, but as the effect is lower in the highest quality trials, a more reasonable estimate is a 15\% relative risk reduction. Based on the risk level of women in these trials, the absolute risk reduction was 0.05\%. Screening also leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, with an estimated 30\% increase, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5\%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged. In addition, 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be diagnosed as breast cancer patients and will be treated unnecessarily. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. Women invited to screening should be fully informed of both benefits and harms.},

Our objective was to investigate whether the other major aspect of virus dynamics, viral replicative capacity, does change. In vitro work has indicated that the viral replicative, capacity increases but in vivo evidence has been lacking. METHODS: As an in vivo measure of the viral replicative capacity, we studied the rate of rebound of plasma HIV RNA level during a 1-week therapy interruption in previously untreated patients who had received 2 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: Such therapy in five previously drug-naive patients with high CD4 lymphocyte counts (mean, 611 x 10(6)/l) and five patients with low counts (mean, 49 x 10(6)/l) led to a mean 2.2 log10 copies/ml decrease in plasma HIV-1 levels (from 5-6 log10 copies/ml) in 2 weeks. This was similar in the two groups. Interruption of therapy for the ensuing week resulted in a stable HIV-1 level for approximately 2 days followed by a rebound towards pretherapy level, which was much more marked in the patients with low CD4 cell counts (estimated mean rise 2.22 log10 versus 1.06 log10 copies/ml; P {\textless} 0.02). After restarting therapy, HIV RNA levels returned to pre-interruption levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings need confirmation, but the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in vivo appears to increase during HIV-1 infection. This increased replicative capacity, for which there are several potential explanations, may be the cause of gradual CD4 lymphocyte depletion},

Since the relevant information for 2008 is not generally available as yet, we used statistical models to estimate incidence and mortality data for 25 cancers in 40 European countries (grouped and individually) in 2008. The calculations are based on published data. If not collected, national rates were estimated from national mortality data and incidence and mortality data provided by local cancer registries of the same or neighbouring country. The estimated 2008 rates were applied to the corresponding country population estimates for 2008 to obtain an estimate of the numbers of cancer cases and deaths in Europe in 2008. There were an estimated 3.2 million new cases of cancer and 1.7 million deaths from cancer in 2008. The most common cancers were colorectal cancers (436,000 cases, 13.6\% of the total), breast cancer (421,000, 13.1\%), lung cancer (391,000, 12.2\%) and prostate cancer (382,000, 11.9\%). The most common causes of death from cancer were lung cancer (342,000 deaths, 19.9\% of the total), colorectal cancer (212,000 deaths, 12.3\%), breast cancer (129,000, 7.5\%) and stomach cancer (117,000, 6.8\%).}

It is not possible to base any conclusions on the limited data available for the small number of people exposed to chrysotile for a maximum period of five months. We believe that the identification and measurement of fibres in autoptic lung tissue from patients with accurately known occupational histories of asbestos dust exposure is useful, and a similar study on a population exclusively exposed to chrysotile would be of considerable interest.}

The XPG polymorphism was assayed by PCR-RFLP method for 497 lung cancer cases, 443 cases of oropharyngeal, laryngeal and esophageal cancers and 912 controls. Binary and polytomous unconditional logistic regression models were fitted to assess the main effects and the effect modifications between the polymorphism and environmental exposures. With the adjustment for potential confounders, the XPG Asp1104Asp genotype was inversely associated with lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, 95\% confidence limits [CL] = 0.38, 1.0) and SCCOLE (OR = 0.47, 95\% CL = 0.27, 0.82), with the combined His1104His and His1104Asp genotypes as the referent. With subjects having genotype Asp1104Asp and no tobacco smoking exposure as the common referent, the ORs on lung cancer were 13 (95\% CL = 4.4, 37) for heavy tobacco smoking ({\textgreater}20 pack-years), 1.9 (95\% CL = 0.78, 4.5) for having at least one copy of 1104His, and 23 (95\% CL = 9.5, 56) for the joint effect, respectively. Compared to non-smokers with the Asp1104Asp genotype, the adjusted OR on SCCOLE for heavy smokers ({\textgreater}20 pack-years) having at least one copy of 1104His was 8.0 (95\% CL = 2.7, 24). Similarly, compared to non-drinkers with the Asp1104Asp genotype, the adjusted OR on SCCOLE for heavy drinkers ({\textgreater} or =3 drinks/day) with at least one copy of 1104His was 10 (95\% CL = 2.7, 38). In conclusion, our study suggests that the XPG Asp1104Asp genotype may be associated with decreased susceptibility to lung cancer and SCCOLE.}

CD8+ lymphocytes are also important for the suppression of many latent pathogens responsible for opportunistic disease in HIV- infected patients. There has been no systematic analysis of the responses of CD8+ lymphocyte counts to antiretroviral therapy. We compared CD8+ lymphocyte responses in seven trials of nucleoside or non- nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors and in two trials of ritonavir, a HIV protease inhibitor. Nucleoside analog and non- nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor monotherapy resulted in no substantial changes in CD8+ counts relative to baseline or placebo. Combination nucleoside analog therapy resulted in variable peak responses (-145 to +240 cells/mm3), which remained significantly above baseline for 0 to 12 weeks. In contrast, ritonavir monotherapy caused a peak increase of 892 CD8+ cells/mm3, which remained significantly above baseline for 32 weeks. There was a significant correlation (Rs 0.61, p = 0.01) between the peak CD4+ cell and CD8+ responses to each therapy, but no significant correlation between the peak viral load responses and peak CD8+ cell responses. These findings suggest that the greater CD8+ response seen with ritonavir may be due to its specific inhibition of HIV protease and also that the CD8+ response is dependent on new CD4+ cell production. The CD8+ lymphocyte proliferation observed with protease inhibitor therapy could result in improved suppression of HIV replication by the immune system and should be confirmed in a prospective trial comparing protease inhibitors with both nucleoside and non-nucleoside analog therapies},

Critics of these attempts point out that ecologic effect estimates are inevitably used as estimates of individual effects, despite disclaimers. A more subtle problem is that ecologic variation in the distribution of individual effects can bias ecologic estimates of contextual effects. The conditions leading to this bias are plausible and perhaps even common in studies of ecosocial factors and health outcomes because social context is not randomized across typical analysis units (administrative regions). By definition, ecologic data contain only marginal observations on the joint distribution of individually defined confounders and outcomes, and so identify neither contextual nor individual-level effects. While ecologic studies can still be useful given appropriate caveats, their problems are better addressed by multilevel study designs, which obtain and use individual as well as group-level data. Nonetheless, such studies often share certain special problems with ecologic studies, including problems due to inappropriate aggregation and problems due to temporal changes in covariate distributions.}

METHODS: Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of prevalence and proportion data. The review was confined to studies reporting on NECs in smears from postmenopausal women or women aged 40+. RESULTS: A total of 22 relevant primary studies were identified from 1970 to 2007. The overall summary estimate for the prevalence of NECs in smears from postmenopausal women or women aged 40+ in all screening smears was 0.4\% (95\% CI 0.2-0.7\%); this was 0.3\% (95\% CI 0.1-0.5\%) and 0.9\% (95\% CI 0.5-1.4\%) for conventional and LBC smears, respectively; P = 0.003 for difference. The overall estimate for the proportion of NECs associated with significant endometrial pathology was 7\% (95\% CI 4-10\%); this was 11\% (95\% CI 8-14\%) and 2\% (95\% CI 1-2\%) for conventional and LBC smears, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001 for difference. In women with significant endometrial pathology, the presence of NECs in followed-up women was associated with abnormal uterine bleeding in 79\% (95\% CI 68-87\%) of cases. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional cytology, LBC may be associated with a higher prevalence of NECs but these are less likely to be associated with endometrial pathology. This finding might be explained by more consistent use of sampling instruments for LBC with better access to the endocervical canal or alternatively by changes over time, broadly coincident with the introduction of LBC, in the population in which NECs are reported. In followed-up women with NECs, most endometrial pathology is accompanied by symptoms, implying that a relatively smaller number of additional cases are identified through follow-up of asymptomatic women.}

The annual number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britain has risen increasingly rapidly from 153 deaths in 1968 to 1848 in 2001 and, using our preferred model, is predicted to peak at around 1950 to 2450 deaths per year between 2011 and 2015. Following this peak, the number of deaths is expected to decline rapidly. The eventual death rate will depend on the background level and any residual asbestos exposure.

DESIGN: A Markov model predicts the outcomes of periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment for cervical cancer among women from 65 to 109 years of age. PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of one million 65-year-old women; representative of the U.S. population. MEASUREMENTS: The costs and yields of screening. RESULTS: Triennial screening reduced mortality from cervical cancer among the elderly by 74\% at a cost of \$2254 per year of life saved. Annual screening increased costs to \$7345 per year of life saved; less frequent schedules yielded lower costs but decreased savings in life. These results were most sensitive to the quality of the Papanicolaou smear and the characteristics of the women using the benefit. If the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou smear was reduced from a baseline estimate of 75\% to 50\% and the specificity was decreased to 87\% from 95\%, the cost effectiveness ratio increased by nearly \$7000 per year of life saved. If triennial screening is targeted to women who have not had regular screening, the program will save money as well as years of life; however, screening women who have been screened regularly is considerably less efficient, increasing costs to \$33,572 per year of life saved. CONCLUSION: The success of the new Medicare benefit depends substantially on physicians assuring that their elderly patients, particularly women without regular prior screening, obtain high quality Papanicolaou smears. The data also show that after a woman 65 years of age or older has a history of regular negative smears, screening is inefficient and can cease.}

METHODS: We consider use of three drugs (A, B and C) where for each drug one and only one viral mutation is associated with ability to replicate (effective reproductive ratio, R {\textgreater} 1) in the presence of that drug as monotherapy. For drug A mutation is a, etc. We define eight populations of short-lived infected cells that live 1 day: Vo with no mutations a, b, c; Va with mutation a only, Vab with mutations a and b, etc. A random number generator was used to determine whether mutations occur in any one round of replication and to sample from a Poisson distribution to determine for each cell the number of cells of the same population created in the next generation, using the R operative at that time. Values of R depended on drug exposure, cost of resistance and availability of target cells. RESULTS: Treatment strategies and the resulting percentage (over 100 runs) developing full "resistance" in 1500 days (Vabc not equal 0) were: (i) ABC 1500 days 0\%; (ii) A 300 days, AB 300 days, ABC 900 days 100\%; (iii) AB 300 days, ABC 1200 days 33\%; (iv) ABC 2/3 1500 days 15\%; (v) ABC 1/2 1500 days 100\%; (vi) ABC 50 days, no drugs 50 days, for 1500 days 1\%, where ABC 2/3 means on-drug for 2 days in every 3, ABC 1/2 represents on-drug for 1 day in every 2, and represents suboptimal adherence.

Hierarchical modeling provides a promising approach for analyzing such data by adding a higher-level structure or prior model for the exposure effects. This prior model can incorporate additional information on similarities among the correlated exposures and can be parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric. We discuss the implications of applying these models and argue for their expanded use in epidemiology. While a prior model adds assumptions to the conventional (first-stage) model, all statistical methods (including conventional methods) make strong intrinsic assumptions about the processes that generated the data. One should thus balance prior modeling assumptions against assumptions of validity, and use sensitivity analyses to understand their implications. In doing so - and by directly incorporating into our analyses information from other studies or allied fields - we can improve our ability to distinguish true causes of disease from noise and bias.}

The purpose of this study was to use a national, population-based sample to estimate the burden of illness in adult survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A total of 410 adult survivors of childhood cancer and 294,641 individuals without cancer were identified from multiple years of the National Health Interview Survey. Multiple measures of burden, general health, and lost productivity were compared using multivariate regression analyses including: logistic, polytomous logit, proportional odds, and linear models. RESULTS: Controlling for the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and survey year, adult survivors of childhood cancer reported poorer outcomes across the majority of general health measures and productivity measures than individuals without cancer. Survivors were more likely to report their health status as fair or poor (24.3\% vs 10.9\%; P{\textless}.001); having any health limitation in any way (12.9\% vs 3.4\%; P{\textless}.001); being unable to work because of health problems (20.9\% vs 6.3\%; P{\textless}.001); and being limited in the amount/kind of work because of health problems (30.9\% vs 10.6\%; P{\textless}.001). When categorized by time since diagnosis, cancer survivors had poor health outcomes in every time interval, with the greatest limitations in the initial 4 years after diagnosis and 30 or more years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Across multiple measures, adult survivors of childhood cancers have poorer health outcomes and more health limitations than similar individuals without cancer.},

In particular, the role and interpretation of random effects models are examined. The modeling of spatial variability is considered and related to an underlying continuous spatial field. The examination of such a field with respect to the modeling of risk in relation to a point source highlights an inconsistency in commonly used approaches. A theme of the paper is to examine how plausible individual-level models relate to those used in practice at the aggregate level. The individual-level models acknowledge confounding, within-area variability in exposures and confounders, measurement error and data anomalies and so we can examine how the area-level versions consider these aspects. We briefly discuss designs that efficiently sample individual data and would appear to be useful in environmental settings.}

The authors review and derive a set of parallel simple formulas for bias factors in the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio from studies with an unmeasured polytomous confounder and a dichotomous exposure and outcome. METHODS: The authors show how the bias formulas are related to and are sometimes simpler than earlier formulas. The article contains three examples, including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis of a preadjusted or conditional estimate. RESULTS: All the bias expressions can be given parallel formulations as the difference or ratio of (i) the sum across confounder strata of each exposure-stratified confounder-outcome effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the exposed and (ii) the sum across confounder strata of the same effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the unexposed. The basic formulas can be applied to scenarios with a polytomous confounder, exposure, or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to aiding design and analysis strategies for confounder control, the bias formulas provide a link between classical standardization decompositions of demography and classical bias formulas of epidemiology. They are also useful in constructing general programs for sensitivity analysis and more elaborate probabilistic risk analyses.}

One generalization is the relaxation of log-linearity in x, lambda(t;x) = lambda(0)(t)exp[r(x)]. Another is the relaxation of the proportional hazards assumption, lambda(t;x) = lambda(0)(t)exp[beta(t)x]. These generalizations are typically considered independently of each other. We propose the product model, lambda(t;x) = lambda(0)(t)exp[beta(t)r(x)] which allows for joint estimation of both effects, and investigate its properties. The functions describing the time-dependent beta(t) and non-linear r(x) effects are modelled simultaneously using regression splines and estimated by maximum partial likelihood. Likelihood ratio tests are proposed to compare alternative models. Simulations indicate that both the recovery of the shapes of the two functions and the size of the tests are reasonably accurate provided they are based on the correct model. By contrast, type I error rates may be highly inflated, and the estimates considerably biased, if the model is misspecified. Applications in cancer epidemiology illustrate how the product model may yield new insights about the role of prognostic factors.}

Of the specimens selected (N = 1,175, 5.50\% of all specimens obtained), 1,072 (91.23\%) had sufficient specimen volume for retesting. The kappa value between all CC laboratories and the HPV QC laboratory was 0.84 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-0.89), with kappa values for individual CCs and the HPV QC laboratory ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Agreement between test results was lowest among results for women with negative cytologic findings (0.73); among those with equivocal or abnormal cytologic findings, kappa values were 0.80 or more.

We fitted the model assuming that acute exposure to radiation results in the creation of initiated cells that are added to the pool of spontaneously initiated cells. In the cancers analyzed, with the exception of lung cancer in females, we found no evidence that radiation-induced initiation was dependent upon age at exposure. In contrast, we found that spontaneous initiation was dependent upon age at exposure in the cancers analyzed except stomach cancer among males, Because exposure to radiation in this cohort occurred at the same time for all members of the cohort, age at exposure is exactly correlated with birth cohort, and the dependence of spontaneous initiation on age at exposure is a reflection of the cohort effects seen in these cancers in Japan. Even without a dependence of radiation-induced initiation on age at exposure, the two-stage model can explain the temporal behavior of the excess relative risk with age at exposure and time since exposure, In particular, the model predicts that excess relative risk is highest among those exposed as children. Moreover, since radiation-induced initiation is not higher among those exposed as children, the excess relative risk in this group is not due to an inherently higher sensitivity to radiation, Our biologically based approach provides another perspective on the temporal behavior of risk after acute exposure to ionizing radiation.

Increased diagnostic activity (e.g., screening) can inflate both incidence and survival. To understand interrelations between incidence, mortality and survival trends and their consequences, we analyzed survival trends in relation to mortality and incidence. Starting with observed survival from EUROCARE, mortality from WHO and using the MIAMOD method, we estimated breast cancer incidence trends from 1970 to 2005 in 10 European countries. To smooth out peaks in incidence and survival due to early diagnosis activity, survival trends were assumed similar to those observed by EUROCARE in 1983-1994. The following patterns emerged: (1) increasing survival with increasing incidence and declining or stable mortality (Sweden, Finland); (2) slight survival increase, marked incidence increase and slight mortality decrease (Denmark, the Netherlands and France); (3) increasing survival, marked decrease in mortality and tendency to incidence stabilization (UK); (4) marked survival increase, steady or decreasing mortality and moderate increases in incidence (Spain, Italy); (5) stable survival, increasing incidence and mortality (Estonia). In most countries survival increased, indicating a real advantage for patients when accompanied by decreasing or stable mortality, and attributable to improved cancer care (Sweden, UK, France, Italy and Spain). In Finland (with high survival), the Netherlands and Denmark, increasing mortality and incidence indicate increasing breast cancer risk, probably related to life-style factors. In Estonia, low and stable survival in the context of increasing incidence and mortality suggests inadequate care.}

Time trends are graphically displayed for the 15 most common forms of cancer. Long-term survival rates strongly improved over time for most forms of cancer. The slope and shape of trend curves obtained by period analysis are very similar to those obtained by traditional survival analysis. However, detection of progress in 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates of newly diagnosed patients could have been advanced by 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and 15-20 years, respectively, with the use of period analysis rather than traditional cohort survival analysis. The authors conclude that period analysis should be routinely used to advance detection of progress in long-term cancer patient survival.}

DESIGN: Patients with documented acute HIV-1 infection were enrolled in four prospective studies: one randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT) and three observational cohort studies. SETTING: All patients were diagnosed and followed in three university affiliated tertiary clinical care centers. METHODS: The chi-square test was used for comparing proportions and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparing continuous variables among these groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the variables independently associated with the duration of acute HIV-1 infection. The differences in mean CD4 and CD8 load between centers were assessed using the random-effect models for the longitudinal data. RESULTS: Minor differences were noted in the frequency of symptoms among subjects enrolled at different locations. RCT patients reported a longer duration of symptoms (31 days) compared with that for observational patients (15 days; P {\textless} 0.0001). For the most common symptoms such as fever, skin rash, arthralgia, myalgia, and headaches, a longer duration was observed in the RCT group compared with that for observational patients (P range, 0.001 to {\textless} 0.0001). T-cells subsets within 100 days of seroconversion did not statistically differ by centre or by mode of recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a selection bias toward patients with longer symptomatic acute HIV-1 infection enrolled in the RCT. Data collected from RCT are not comparable to that collected in observational studies. However, data from collaborative international studies can be combined.}

Recent advances have focused on flexible modeling of the overall shape of latency. Methods are needed to allow for varying shapes of latency under different exposure profiles. A tensor product spline model is proposed for describing exposure-response relationships for protracted time-dependent occupational exposure histories in epidemiologic studies. The methods use flexible multi-dimensional techniques to jointly model age, latency and exposure-response effects. In analyzing data from the Colorado Plateau Uranium Miners cohort, a model that allows for varying exposure-dependent latency shapes is found to be superior to models that only allowed for an overall latency curve. Specifically, the model suggests that, at low exposure levels risk increased at short latencies followed by a slow decline for longer latency periods. On the other hand, risk was higher but did not change much by latency for higher exposure levels. The proposed methodology has the advantage of allowing for latency functions that vary by exposure levels and, conversely, exposure-response relationships that are influenced by the latency structure.

METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer-based model of cervical carcinogenesis was performed. Strategies included no screening, opportunistic screening (status quo), organized screening using either conventional or liquid-based cytology conducted at different frequencies. The main outcome measures were cancer incidence reduction, years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Data were from local hospitals and laboratories, clinical trials, prospective studies and other published literature. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, a simulation of the current situation of opportunistic screening using cervical cytology produced a nearly 40 per cent reduction in the lifetime risk of cervical cancer. However, with organized screening every 3, 4 and 5 years, corresponding reductions with conventional (and liquid-based) cytology were 90.4 (92.9), 86.8 (90.2) and 83.2 per cent (87.3 per cent) compared with no screening. For all cytology-based screening strategies, opportunistic screening was more costly and less effective than an organized programme of screening every 3, 4 and 5 years. Every 3-, 4- and 5-year screening cost \$12,300, \$7100 and \$800 per YLS, each compared with the next best alternative. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the status quo of opportunistic screening, adopting a policy of organized, mass cervical screening in Hong Kong can substantially increase benefits and reduce costs.}

A DNA test for 13 HPV types that can cause cervical cancer is approved in the United States for co-screening with cytology of women {\textgreater}or=30 years old and for triage of women of all ages with equivocal cytology. However, most infections with HPV are benign. We evaluated trade-offs between specificity and sensitivity for approximately 40 HPV types in predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and cancer in two prospective studies: a population-based screening study that followed 6196 women aged 30-94 years from Costa Rica for 7 years and a triage study that followed 3363 women aged 18-90 years with equivocal cytology in four U.S. centers for 2 years. For both screening and triage, testing for more than about 10 HPV types decreased specificity more than it increased sensitivity. The minimal increases in sensitivity and in negative predictive value achieved by adding HPV types to DNA tests must be weighed against the projected burden to thousands of women falsely labeled as being at high risk of cervical cancer.}

Because cancer survival rates often vary by the age of cancer patients, and because the age structure of cancer patients often varies between populations, age adjustment is crucial for comparative analyses of cancer survival rates. However, traditional age adjustment often breaks down for long-term survival rates, particularly for sparse data, and it may provide inconsistent results for relative survival rates, even if age adjustment is made to the study population's own age distribution. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative approach to age adjustment of both absolute and relative survival rates to overcome both the practical and conceptual problems inherent in traditional age adjustment. We outline the computational realisation of this approach, and we give an empirical illustration of its application using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry.}

If initiation were halved and some of the initiation were delayed rather than eliminated, substantially smaller reduction would result.Conclusions: Policies that increase cessation rates are needed to reduce the number of current smokers and the more near-term health problems.}

METHOD: 148 patients with PHI were recruited. Participants were treated with open-label HAART for at least 76 weeks. Participants with sustained viremia {\textless}50 copies/mL were randomized to one of three 5-month, double-blinded study treatment groups: HAART alone, HAART + ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452), or HAART + ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) + Remune. After a further month of HAART alone, all treatment was stopped where plasma HIV-1 RNA remained at {\textless}50 copies/mL. Intensive virologic and immunologic monitoring during a 24-week observation period followed treatment interruption. Patients who met treatment reintroduction criteria were offered HAART rescue},

Existing methods for the statistical analysis of small area risk are mostly based on smoothing methods. However, these methods often smooth over large discontinuities in the risk surface which might be important to maintain for the purposes of resource allocation. In this paper we propose a method that involves the use of spatial mixtures of components that can provide a balance between smoothness and the maintenance of discontinuity.

In contrast to wild-type Cx45.6, the mutants failed to form functional gap junctions, and Cx45.6(P88S) and, to a lesser degree, Cx45.6(D47A) functioned in a dominant-negative manner. Interestingly, overexpression of both mutants incapable of forming gap junctions significantly increased epithelial-fiber differentiation to a level comparable to that of wild-type Cx45.6. To map the functional domain of Cx45.6, we generated a C-terminus chimera as well as deletion mutants. Overexpression of Cx56(*)45.6C, the mutant in which the C-terminus of Cx56 was replaced with that of Cx45.6, had a stimulatory effect on lens cell differentiation similar to that of Cx45.6. However, cells overexpressing Cx45.6(*)56C, the mutant in which C-terminus of Cx45.6 was replaced with that of Cx56, and Cx45.6(-C), in which the C-terminus was deleted, failed to promote differentiation. Taken together, we conclude that the expression of Cx45.6, but not Cx45.6-dependent gap junction channels, is involved in lens epithelial-fiber cell differentiation, and the C-terminal domain of Cx45.6 plays a predominant role in mediating this process.}

This report updates statistics on lung, female breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers and highlights the uses of selected surveillance data to assist development of state-based cancer control plans. METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates from 1996 through 2000 are from state and metropolitan area cancer registries that met NAACCR criteria for highest quality. Death rates are based on underlying cause-of-death data. Long-term trends and rates for major racial and ethnic populations are based on NCI and CDC data. Incidence trends from 1975 through 2000 were adjusted for reporting delays. State-specific screening and risk factor survey data are from the CDC and other federal and private organizations. RESULTS: Cancer incidence rates for all cancer sites combined increased from the mid-1970s through 1992 and then decreased from 1992 through 1995. Observed incidence rates for all cancers combined were essentially stable from 1995 through 2000, whereas the delay-adjusted trend showed an increase that had borderline statistical significance (P =.05). Increases in the incidence rates of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men offset a long-term decrease in lung cancer in men. Death rates for all cancer sites combined decreased beginning in 1994 and stabilized from 1998 through 2000, resulting in part from recent revisions in cause-of-death codes. Death rates among men continued to decline throughout the 1990s, whereas trends in death rates among women were essentially unchanged from 1998 through 2000. Analysis of state data for the leading cancers revealed mixed progress in achieving national objectives for improving cancer screening, risk factor reduction, and decreases in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall cancer incidence and death rates began to stabilize in the mid- to late 1990s. The recent increase in the delay-adjusted trend will require monitoring with additional years of data. Further reduction in the burden of cancer is possible but will require the continuation of strong federal, state, local, and private partnerships to increase dissemination of evidence-based cancer control programs to all segments of the population.}

Both consequences have considerable impact on the net benefits of screening. METHODS: We developed simulation models based on results of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), which enrolled 42,376 men and in which 1498 cases of prostate cancer were identified, and on baseline prostate cancer incidence and stage distribution data. The models were used to predict mean lead times, overdetection rates, and ranges (corresponding to approximate 95\% confidence intervals) associated with different screening programs. RESULTS: Mean lead times and rates of overdetection depended on a man's age at screening. For a single screening test at age 55, the estimated mean lead time was 12.3 years (range = 11.6-14.1 years) and the overdetection rate was 27\% (range = 24\%-37\%); at age 75, the estimates were 6.0 years (range = 5.8-6.3 years) and 56\% (range = 53\%-61\%), respectively. For a screening program with a 4-year screening interval from age 55 to 67, the estimated mean lead time was 11.2 years (range = 10.8-12.1 years), and the overdetection rate was 48\% (range = 44\%-55\%). This screening program raised the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis from 6.4\% to 10.6\%, a relative increase of 65\% (range = 56\%-87\%). In annual screening from age 55 to 67, the estimated overdetection rate was 50\% (range = 46\%-57\%) and the lifetime prostate cancer risk was increased by 80\% (range = 69\%-116\%). Extending annual or quadrennial screening to the age of 75 would result in at least two cases of overdetection for every clinically relevant cancer detected. CONCLUSIONS: These model-based lead-time estimates support a prostate cancer screening interval of more than 1 year.}

Using these mortality data, incidence rates in 2000 and 2005 were estimated by means of the ratio of cancer cases/deaths (by site, age, and sex) in good quality cancer registries in China. A total of 2.1 million cancer cases were estimated for the year 2000 (1.3 million in men, 0.8 million in women), with the most common sites being lung, liver, and stomach in men, and breast, lung, and stomach in women. The total number of new cases is expected to increase by 14.6\% by 2005, primarily as a result of population growth and aging. In addition, the rising rates of lung cancer incidence (in both sexes) and breast cancer mean that there will be much greater increases in the number of cases at these two sites (27\% for lung cancer in men, 38\% for lung and breast cancer in women).

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Against a background of increasing cancer rates in the mid-1980s, Europe Against Cancer launched an ambitious programme aiming to reduce cancer mortality by 15\% by the year 2000. A programme of activities and research, focussing on three major themes [prevention (particularly tobacco control), screening, and education and training], was developed together with the European Code Against Cancer. METHODS: To evaluate the outcome of the programme, all cancer mortality data were abstracted for each member state of the European Union (EU) until the most recent year available. For each gender group in each member state, age-specific rates were estimated for 2000. For each country-gender grouping, the standardized mortality rate (SMR) and expected numbers of deaths in 2000 were calculated based on the age-specific rates for 1985 and the population estimates for 2000. The ratio of the SMR in 2000 to that of 1985, was used as the measure to compare mortality rates. RESULTS: In 1985, there were 850 194 cancer deaths in the EU. Based solely on demographic considerations, this number was expected to rise to 1 033 083 in the year 2000. Between 1985 and 2000, the number of cancer deaths increased in both men (+12\%) and women (+9\%). The target of a 15\% reduction in the expected numbers of cancer deaths in the EU was not met, although the 10\% reduction in number of deaths expected in men and 8\% in women, along with a 11\% reduction in risk of cancer death in men and a 10\% reduction in women, was noteworthy. Only Austria and Finland achieved the 15\% reductions in deaths in both men and women. The UK and Luxembourg (where the small population and annual number of deaths make interpretation difficult) came close to meeting these targets, as did Italy. Portugal and Greece had the poorest performance, with increases in each gender group. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer deaths in the EU were expected to rise from 850 194 in 1985 to 1 033 083 in 2000. It is estimated that there will be 940 510 cancer deaths that year, due to the decline in risk observed since 1985. The Europe Against Cancer programme appears to have been associated with the avoidance of 92 573 cancer deaths in the year 2000. With few exceptions, most countries are experiencing declining trends in cancer death rates, which seem set to continue, at least in the near future. Renewed tobacco control efforts are clearly needed for women, and there is a strong case for the introduction of organized breast and cervix screening programmes in all member states. Continuing to emphasize prevention within cancer control will help to promote the continuing decline in death rates in the future.}

METHODS: Over a 12-month period, all women attending the University of Ottawa colposcopy clinic for evaluation and follow-up of ASCUS/LGSIL Pap smears were recruited. Demographic data included age, nature of the Pap smear abnormality, gravidity, parity, occupation and education level, smoking history, previous history of abnormal smears, colposcopic examination and treatment, and current method of contraception. The women were asked to rate their level of concern over their Pap smear abnormality, from 0 (not concerned) to 10 (very concerned). Women's knowledge regarding the role of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the rationale behind the use of HPV testing was assessed by the clinic nurse as being minimal, moderate, or good, as defined by pre-specified criteria. Upon explanation by the nurses of the results of the recent ALTS (ASCUS/LGSIL Triage Study) trial, the women were asked to state whether they preferred to continue with regular colposcopic surveillance every 6 months, or to use the results of the HPV test, if negative, to reduce the number of colposcopy examinations to one annually. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to identify significant demographic factors associated with the women's preference for incorporation of HPV testing in their follow-up. All P values less than.10 were considered to be statistically significant, due to the exploratory nature of the study. RESULTS: Of the 100 women who participated in the study, 42\% presented with ASCUS. The mean age (+/- SD) of the women was 33.63 +/- 11.25 years (range, 18-75 years); 66\% were office workers with at least a community college degree, 86\% reported previous abnormal Pap smears, and 67\% had previously been seen for colposcopy. Fifty-eight percent of the women rated their concern level as being 6 or more, while 15\% ranked their concerns as maximal at 10. In terms of knowledge about HPV, 75\% of the women had no or very minimal knowledge of the role of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. With regard to HPV testing, 84\% of the study group had either never heard of the test or had only a minimal knowledge of HPV testing. After being informed of the ALTS results, 64\% of the women chose to use HPV testing to help in triaging the needs for frequent colposcopy. Logistic regression modelling showed that a college level education (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-;5.45; P =.06) and history of previous treatment for abnormal Pap smears (OR, 3.31; CI, 0.88- 12.46; P =.07) were closely associated with the adoption of HPV testing in clinical management. CONCLUSION: There exists a significant lack of knowledge about HPV and its role in the pathogenesis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.Women who have received previous treatments for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and those with college-level educations were more likely to adopt this new technology as part of their care.}

METHODS: Women with a recent Pap smear report of ASCUS (n = 169) or LSIL (n = 110) had a repeat Pap smear, sampling of the cervix for HCT HPV DNA assay and a colposcopy examination. Data were evaluated using three different triage thresholds for colposcopy examination: a repeat Pap smear of persistent ASCUS or more severe dysplasia, a finding of persistent LSIL or more severe dysplasia, and a carcinogenic HPV test result. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detecting CIN 2/3 were 70\%, 45\%, 7\%, and 96\% for a repeat Pap smear using an ASCUS-positive threshold and 20\%, 86\%, 8\%, and 94\% for a repeat Pap smear using an LSIL-positive threshold, respectively, when women with an initial ASCUS Pap smear were considered. HPV testing for carcinogenic viruses alone or in combination with a repeat Pap smear (using ASCUS as a positive threshold) yielded results of 50\%, 67\%, 9\%, and 96\%, respectively, and 70\%, 37\%, 7\%, and 95\%, respectively, for detecting CIN 2/3. In women with an initial LSIL Pap smear, respective values for detecting CIN 2/3 by a repeat Pap smear with an ASCUS threshold were 92\%, 26\%, 14\%, and 96\%, and for an LSIL threshold 23\%, 64\%, 8\%, and 86\%, respectively. Hybrid Capture HPV testing alone or in combination with a repeat Pap smear yielded 69\%, 43\%, 14\%, and 91\%, respectively, and 100\%, 21\%, 14\%, and 100\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A Pap smear triage threshold restricted to LSIL or more severe dysplasia for women with prior ASCUS or LSIL Pap smear results was clearly ineffective for detecting high-grade cervical precancerous lesions. In contrast, when the repeat Pap smear triage threshold was expanded to include persistent ASCUS as abnormal, 83\% of the women with CIN 2/3 were detected. Detection of carcinogenic HPV DNA using the HCT test was almost as sensitive for detecting CIN 2/3 as a solitary repeat Pap smear using an ASCUS or more severe positive threshold. Combining the HPV test with a repeat Pap smear did not significantly improve the sensitivity of cytology for detecting high-grade CIN. This study suggests that women with ASCUS and particularly LSIL Pap smears should be referred for a colposcopy examination until better triage methods become available.}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 243 patients from the Southern Alberta Clinic had started a protease inhibitor for the first time and had been followed up for a median time of 32 weeks. Standard survival techniques including Kaplan-Meier techniques and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine which factors were related to viral load becoming undetectable. RESULTS: At 24 weeks after first exposure to a protease inhibitor, 52.8\% of the patients [95\% confidence interval (Cl), 45.2-56.6] had achieved an undetectable viral load. In a multivariate analysis, those with a higher initial viral load were less likely to become undetectable [relative hazard (RH), 0.50; 95\% Cl, 0.35-0.70; P {\textless} 0.0001], whereas those starting more new drugs (RH per new drug, 1.54; 95\% Cl, 1.01-2.11; P = 0.048) were significantly more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load. Amongst 111 patients whose viral load became undetectable, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that 15.5\% of patients experienced re-emergence of detectable viral load at 24 weeks after the first undetectable viral load. A higher CD4 cell count was associated with a lower risk of viral load becoming detectable (RH, 0.73; 95\% Cl, 0.53-1.00; P = 0.049), as was treatment with indinavir (versus any other protease inhibitor RH, 0.17; 95\% Cl, 0.03-0.86; P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients in a routine clinic setting achieved an undetectable viral load measurement after first starting a protease inhibitor; viral load in patients with a higher CD4 cell count was more likely to become and stay undetectable. There was no evidence that patients who were drug-naive experienced significantly worse virological effects than drug-experienced patients, as long as the same number of new drugs was started at the date of first exposure to a protease inhibitor. Further follow-up of these patients is warranted to study the longer term effects of treatment with protease inhibitors},

However, whilst it is flexible and efficient, the gain framework based on backfitting with linear smoothers presents some difficulties when it comes to model selection and inference. On the other hand, the mathematically elegant work of Wahba (Spline Models for Observational Data (1990)) and co-workers on Generalized Spline Smoothing (GSS) provides a rigorous framework for model selection (SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput. 12 (1991) 383) and inference with GAMs constructed from smoothing splines: but unfortunately these models are computationally very expensive with operations counts that are of cubic order in the number of data. A 'middle way' between these approaches is to construct GAMs using penalized regression splines (e.g. Marx and Eilers, Comput. Statist. Data Anal. (1998)). In this paper, we develop this idea further and show how GAMs constructed using penalized regression splines can be used to get most of the practical benefits of GSS models, including well founded model selection and multi-dimensional smooth terms, with the ease of use and low computational cost of backfit GAMs. Inference with the resulting methods also requires slightly fewer approximations than are employed in the GAM modelling software provided in Splus. This paper presents the basic mathematical and numerical approach to GAMs implemented in the R package mdcv, and includes two environmental examples using the methods as implemented in the package.

At stake is the future emphasis of tobacco control: should we alter the current allocation of resources between treatment of individual smokers and modification of the psychosocial environment through public education and policy measures? We review the evidence and conclude that: (1) hardening is probably occurring in the sense that, compared with earlier generations, many of today's smokers possibly do have greater difficulty quitting, or are inherently less willing to do so. (2) Hardening may be most usefully construed in the context of specific groups of smokers, such as the mentally ill, who may constitute a growing fraction of the remaining smoking population. (3) Using conventional measures, however, we find little evidence that the population of smokers as a whole is hardening. Cessation rates have not decreased. (4) Truly hard-core smokers necessarily constitute a very small fraction of the population. Quitting-susceptible smokers continue to dominate the smoking population. (5) Hardening and the potential existence of true hard-core smokers recommend creative thinking about, and devotion of resources to, finding new ways to help the most dependent smokers to quit. (6) Sound research recommends the expansion of comprehensive tobacco-control programs in both the public and private sectors, and does not support reallocation of resources from such programs toward more intensive individualized treatment.

By decreasing the exposure to passive smoking and its acute cardiovascular effects, smoking regulations may cause an immediate drop in AMI incidence, beginning from the initial days after their introduction. Using simulations, we quantified this expected decrease. METHODS: Expected AMI decreases were estimated using several parameters, including prevalence of exposure to passive and active smoking, relative risks of AMI associated with active and passive smoking, decrease in exposure to passive smoking after the introduction of the regulation, and level of susceptibility of active smokers to exposure to passive smoking. RESULTS: After evaluating several possible combinations of these parameters, we found that AMI reductions of 5-15\% seem likely. For example, a scenario with a population average of 5 hours per week of overall exposure to passive smoking, a 50\% reduction in this exposure after the introduction of the regulation, an acute relative risk (RR) of AMI of 4.5 in the first hour after passive smoking exposure, and similar susceptibility to passive smoking among both active and passive smokers translates into a 8.6\% decrease in AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking regulations can cause immediate and relevant decreases in AMI through the prevention of exposure to passive smoking.},

We described baseline characteristics of cases in the Victorian Radical Prostatectomy Register (VRPR), investigated possible associations between demographic characteristics and characteristics at diagnosis and at surgery and trends over time. METHODS: The VRPR is a population-based series of all RPs performed in Victoria from July 1995 to December 2000 (n=2,154). RESULTS: On average, socio-economic status for cases was higher than for the general Victorian population (34\% vs 20\% in the highest quintile respectively, p{\textless}0.0001). The proportion of PSA-detected cases increased from 53\% in 1995 to 79\% in 2000 (p for linear trend=0.0004). Age at surgery and PSA levels at diagnosis decreased over time (p=0.006 and p=0.04 respectively). The proportion of cases with Gleason score {\textless} or =5 from RP decreased from 35\% in 1995 to 14\% in 2000, while cases with Gleason score 6-7 increased from 60\% to 79\%. Similar trends were observed for Gleason score from biopsy. We found little evidence of significant trends over time in other pathological characteristics relevant to prognosis. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The VRPR provides a unique whole of population based description of radical prostatectomy in Victoria, confirms findings previously reported in single institution clinical series overseas such as migration to younger age at surgery and to Gleason scores 6 to 7, and provides a resource for evaluating RP outcomes in the future.}

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven dimensions of health status: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. RESULTS: Examined separately low job control, high job demands, and low work related social support were associated with poor health status at baseline as well as greater functional declines over the four year follow up period. Examined in combination, women with low job control, high job demands, and low work related social support ("iso-strain" jobs) had the greatest functional declines. These associations could not be explained by age, body mass index, comorbid disease status, alcohol consumption, smoking status, education level, exercise level, employment status, marital status, or presence of a confidant. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse psychosocial work conditions are important predictors of poor functional status and its decline over time.}

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{\textgreater}{\textgreater}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

Most studies have revealed little variation in risk factors between the two subtypes. This study compared generation-specific trends in eight European countries, hypothesizing that similar temporal pattern by birth cohort implied that seminoma and nonseminoma had a largely comparable etiology. The results are presented using the age-period-cohort model and the nonidentifiability problem highlighted by partitioning the age, period, and cohort effects in terms of their linear and curvature component parts, assuming a priori that cohort effects predominated. Despite uniform overall increases by calendar period, declining rates of nonseminoma but not pure seminoma were observed in the majority of countries during the 1990s. The subtype trends were, however, largely analogous on a birth cohort scale. Notable observations were a decline in rates of both subtypes among recent birth cohorts in Switzerland and a short-term wartime effect in several countries, involving an attenuation of increasing risk of both subtypes in men born in 1940 to 1945. Departures from the steady increases in testicular cancer over time were likely to occur for nonseminomas some years ahead of seminoma on a period scale. The importance of birth cohort coincided with the view that given a short time interval of susceptibility to exposures earlier in life and a biologically constant time to diagnosis, all temporal changes in rate-limiting exposures should appear as generational effects. Trends in seminoma and nonseminoma conform to largely the same temporal patterns on this scale, implying that they share important etiologic factors.}

DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS: 62 homosexual men with documented HIV-1 seroconversion. SETTING: University outpatient setting. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical status, CD4+ T-cell counts, and plasma and serum samples were obtained every 6 months. Human immunodeficiency virus RNA in plasma was quantitated with a branched-DNA (bDNA) assay. Serum samples were assayed for neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin, and immune complex dissociated HIV-1 p24 antigen. RESULTS: 18 of 62 (29\%) men developed AIDS; 21 (34\%) had a significant decline in the CD4+ T-cell count without AIDS; and 23 (37\%) had a stable CD4+ T-cell count. For each participant, HIV-1 RNA results were categorized into one of four groups: 1) detection of HIV-1 RNA ({\textgreater} 1 x 10(4) genome equivalents/mL [Eq/mL]) in all samples; 2) detection in most samples ({\textgreater} or = 50\%); 3) detection in fewer than 50\% of samples; and 4) detection in none of the samples. Detection of HIV-1 RNA in all or most samples was strongly associated with AIDS (16 of 18 patients) and a decline in the CD4+ T-cell count (13 of 21 patients) compared with a stable CD4+ T-cell count (4 of 23 patients; P {\textless} 0.001). Conversely, the absence of HIV-1 RNA ({\textless} 1 x 10(4) Eq/mL) in all or most samples was associated with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (19 of 23 patients) and a lower risk for AIDS or decline in the CD4+ T-cell count (10 of 39 patients; P {\textless} 0.001). In multivariate analysis of all laboratory values at the seroconversion visit, a plasma HIV-1 RNA level greater than 1 x 10(5) Eq/mL was the most powerful predictor of AIDS (odds ratio, 10.8; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma HIV-1 RNA is a strong, CD4+ T-cell-independent predictor of a rapid progression to AIDS after HIV-1 seroconversion.}

RECENT FINDINGS: Natural history studies of HPV infection in healthy young women show that infection is quite prevalent, but is generally transient. New and sensitive technologies such as HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology are more likely to detect cytologic abnormalities in young women who are at low risk for actual invasive cervical disease. This sensitivity potentially places adolescents at risk for increased anxiety, testing, and intervention. The multi-center ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study has shown that HPV DNA testing can be used safely to minimize intervention in many cases. SUMMARY: HPV infection is common in young women, but rarely progresses to invasive cervical disease. Providers need to inform themselves about new professional society guidelines that suggest delaying initiation of cervical cancer screening to within 3 years of onset of sexual activity. Given the idiosyncrasies of this population, the authors counsel using clinical discretion when applying these guidelines to individual teenagers. In light of the extremely low likelihood of invasive disease in this age group, providers must separate the provision of contraceptive services and sexually transmitted disease screening from requirements for cervical cancer screening.}

We empirically assessed this potential "side-effect" of age adjustment using data from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Analyses of five-year absolute and relative survival for patients diagnosed in 1990-1994, and age adjustment to the age structure of patients diagnosed in 1985-1989, were used as examples. Various patterns of selective under-ascertainment were simulated, and the bias in crude and age adjusted five-year survival rates was compared. Age adjusted estimates were less biased in most scenarios, which may be an additional argument for application of age adjustment in the analysis and reporting of population-based cancer survival rates.}

METHODS: We analysed data from PCBaSe Sweden, a database based on the National Prostate Cancer Register, which covers over 96\% of prostate cancer cases in Sweden. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) of deep-venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, and arterial embolism were calculated by comparing observed and expected (using the total Swedish male population) occurrences of thromboembolic disease, taking into account age, calendar-time, number of thromboembolic diseases, and time since previous thromboembolic disease. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2007, 30 642 men received primary endocrine therapy, 26 432 curative treatment, and 19 526 surveillance. 1881 developed a thromboembolic disease. For men on endocrine therapy, risks for DVT (SIR 2.48, 95\% CI 2.25-2.73) and pulmonary embolism (1.95, 1.81-2.15) were increased, although this was not the case for arterial embolism (1.00, 0.82-1.20). Similar patterns were seen for men who received curative treatment (DVT: 1.73, 1.47-2.01; pulmonary embolism: 2.03, 1.79-2.30; arterial embolism: 0.95, 0.69-1.27) and men who were on surveillance (DVT: 1.27, 1.08-1.47; pulmonary embolism: 1.57, 1.38-1.78; arterial embolism: 1.08, 0.87-1.33). Increased risks for thromboembolic disease were maintained when patients were stratified by age and tumour stage. INTERPRETATION: All men with prostate cancer were at higher risk of thromboembolic diseases, with the highest risk for those on endocrine therapy. Our results indicate that prostate cancer itself, prostate cancer treatments, and selection mechanisms all contribute to increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Thromboembolic disease should be a concern when managing patients with prostate cancer. FUNDING: Swedish Research Council, Stockholm Cancer Society, and Cancer Research UK.},

METHODS: Annual measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) and plasma concentrations of retinol, carotene and vitamin E have been made since 1992. Mixed effects models were used to examine the associations between lung function and the plasma vitamin levels of retinol, carotene and vitamin E. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, higher plasma retinol and carotene concentrations were significantly associated with higher levels of lung function at entry into the study, while vitamin E concentrations were associated with lower entry lung function. Retinol was associated with a less steep decline of lung function over time, while carotene concentrations were associated with an increased decline of lung function over time and vitamin E levels were not associated with changes of lung function over time. CONCLUSION: These results support a beneficial relationship between plasma concentrations of retinol on the levels and rates of change of lung function, while showing no such consistent beneficial effect for plasma levels of beta-carotene or vitamin E.}

These have been linked to cohort-based changes in lifestyle factors. The effect of the changes in the reproductive risk factors on the changes in the rates, and the relative importance of the reproductive characteristics in Slovenia, a country which has not had much breast cancer screening, are investigated. METHODS: Data on breast cancer incidence for 1971-1993 were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Slovenia (Registry). The Registry covers the whole population of the Republic of Slovenia (1.99 million on 30 June 1993). The statistical analysis uses parametric age-period-cohort models. RESULTS: Breast cancer incidence has increased by 70\% in Slovenia from 1971 to 1993, These changes are dominated by cohort effects and the cohorts born in 1907-1922 have the greatest increase in incidence. Period effects on changes in incidence were modest. The percentage of nulliparous women in the cohort and the average family size in the cohort explained 38\% of the variation in the cohort effects. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of nulliparous women in the cohort is the most important reproductive variable associated with the trends in the rates, with breast cancer risk predicted to be higher in cohorts with a larger percentage of nulliparous women. As the cohorts born 1932-1946 have a more favourable reproductive pattern as regards breast cancer risk, compared to the 1907-1922 cohorts, age-specific incidence rates in Slovenia would be predicted to decline in the future in the absence of changes in the other risk factors.}

The objective of this report was to refine estimates of the possible risks and benefits of donor-deferral strategies that are aimed at avoiding transmission of vCJD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of the effect of donor deferral on the blood supply in Australia were based on a 1998 survey of blood donors. The number of donations from donors potentially infected with vCJD and excluded by donor deferral was estimated based on published estimates of the size of the vCJD epidemic in the UK and assuming that the risk of vCJD in Australian blood donors was proportional to the time lived in the UK between 1980 and 1996. The possible increased number of blood donations that were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) and made during a window period (as a result of increased donations from first-time donors) was estimated using published methods. RESULTS: A strategy of deferring donations in Australia from people who have lived in the UK for 6 months or longer, between 1980 and 1996, was estimated to result in exclusion of 5.3\% of all blood donations, corresponding to 50 100 donations in 1998. It was estimated that the annual number of blood donations made by donors potentially infected with vCJD is 1.15 (range 0.02--31.1, based on the uncertainty in the UK prevalence estimate). Donor deferral was estimated to remove 0.92 (range 0.02--25.1) of these donations. Replacement of 33\%, 50\% and 100\% of excluded donations by donations from first-time donors, was estimated to result in an increase of 0.0010, 0.0019 and 0.0044, respectively, of HIV-infected donations per year donated during the window period; in an increase of 0.021, 0.038 and 0.089, respectively, of HCV-infected donations per year; and in an increase of 0.18, 0.33 and 0.76, respectively, of HBV-infected donations per year. CONCLUSIONS: The large uncertainties involved in these analyses mean that estimates must be interpreted cautiously, but the data does suggest that donor deferral may exclude more donations from donors potentially infected with vCJD than the corresponding increase, caused by donor replacement, of window-period donations possibly infected with HIV, HCV or HBV},

The time trend for bladder cancer, however, is not clear in Connecticut. The current study examined the long-term trend of bladder cancer in Connecticut. Our results show that urinary bladder cancer has been increasing, with a marked increase among males. The rate of increase, however, has slowed since the early 1980s. Birth-cohort examination shows that the rates have leveled off for those born after about 1935 in both males and females. Age-period-cohort modeling results also show that the birth-cohort patterns of bladder cancer are somewhat similar to those observed for lung cancer in Connecticut, thus supporting the findings from analytical epidemiologic studies which indicate that cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for urinary bladder cancer. Our results also suggest that the difference in environmental and occupational exposures between males and females may be responsible for the large difference in the incidence rate of bladder cancer seen between the sexes.}

Early detection has the potential to decrease the disproportionate burden of disease in these vulnerable groups at a reasonable cost to society. Yet despite impressive overall gains in use of mammography and Pap smears, older women, especially older minority women, remain underrepresented in screening programs. Physician recommendation is one of the most powerful predictors of screening across all age, socioeconomic, and ethnic groups. The overwhelming majority of older women, make one or more physician visits each year, each of which represents an opportunity to screen for breast and cervical cancer. Although older women will accept screening if it is offered by their providers, physicians are less likely to offer it to them than to their younger, white patients. Conflicting professional recommendations for screening older women, leaving older women out of clinical trials of screening efficacy, competing causes of mortality with increasing age, and possible negative attitudes held by physicians and patients all contribute to the underscreening of older women. Cancer control challenges for the next century include defining groups of women most likely to benefit from screening (based on age, disease risk, competing mortality, and quality of life), improving regular use of early detection, educating providers, and conducting research on age-mediated differences in breast or cervical cancer biology that could affect screening recommendations.}

DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive analysis using routinely collected data of observed trends in PSA testing from 1989 to 2006, and prostate cancer cases and deaths from 1972 to 2005 in NSW. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-standardised and age-specific rates and joinpoint regression to identify changes in trends; projected trends observed before the introduction of PSA testing to quantify its impact on incidence and mortality rates. RESULTS: The number of PSA tests per year more than doubled between 1994 and 2006. Age-standardised incidence of prostate cancer peaked in 1994, fell by 10.0\% per year to 1998 and then increased by 4.9\% per year from 2001 to 2005. An estimated 19 602 (43\%) more men than expected from preceding trends were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1989 and 2005 after PSA testing was introduced. The incidence of recorded advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis fell from 13.0 per 100,000 men in 1987-1991 to 7.0 per 100,000 men in 2002-2005. The age-standardised mortality from prostate cancer increased by 3.6\% per year between 1984 and 1990 and then fell by 2.0\% per year to 2005. CONCLUSIONS: There was a sustained increase in prostate cancer incidence in NSW after PSA testing was introduced. While falls in the incidence of advanced disease at diagnosis and mortality from prostate cancer after 1993 are consistent with a benefit from PSA testing, other explanations cannot be excluded.},

Thus, the level to which the CD4 lymphocyte count has declined, rather than the length of time since seroconversion, is considered as an individual's survival interval. The survival interval may be censored (due to lack of follow-up) or treated as an interval to failure (if the individual develops AIDS). The Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) estimates, of the proportion of individuals developing AIDS before reaching a given low CD4 lymphocyte count, may be useful for determining when prophylactic treatment should begin},

DESIGN--A decision analysis modeling three strategies: radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy, and watchful waiting, with delayed hormonal therapy if metastatic disease develops. We modeled the main benefit of treatment as a reduction in the chance of death or disutility from metastatic disease. These benefits were offset in the model by the risks of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The model was used to analyze expected outcomes by tumor grade (well, moderately, and poorly differentiated) for men 60 to 75 years of age. DATA--Probabilities and rates for important clinical events, obtained through review of the literature for prostatic carcinoma and analysis of Medicare claims data. MAIN RESULTS--Several patterns emerged within the range of uncertainty about the risks and benefits of treatment for prostatic carcinoma. In patients with well-differentiated tumor grades, based on clinical staging, treatment at best offers limited benefit in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy and may result in harm to the patient. Among patients with moderately or poorly differentiated tumors, if we use the most optimistic assumptions about treatment efficacy, then patients aged 60 to 65 years would benefit from either radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy, compared with watchful waiting. However, in most other cases, treatment offers less than a 1-year improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy or decreases the quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with watchful waiting. Invasive treatment generally appears to be harmful for patients older than 70 years. CONCLUSIONS--Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy may benefit selected groups of patients with localized prostate cancer, particularly younger patients with higher-grade tumors. However, our model shows that in most cases the potential benefits of therapy are small enough that the choice of therapy is sensitive to the patient's preferences for various outcomes and discounting. The choice of watchful waiting is a reasonable alternative to invasive treatment for many men with localized prostatic carcinoma.}

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationship of viral load response to ART with baseline CD4 cell count and baseline viral load. DESIGN: Inception cohort of 3430 therapy-naive patients with HIV, of whom 3226 patients had at least 1 viral load count after the start of ART. SETTING: Three cohort studies of patients cared for in HIV clinics in Europe between 1996 and 2000. PATIENTS: All patients initiating ART consisting of at least 3 drugs initiated in or after 1996 and for whom CD4 cell count and viral load were available in the prior 6 months (at most). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Viral load decrease to below 500 copies/mL; viral load rebound to above 500 copies/mL (2 consecutive values). RESULTS: Of 3226 patients during the median follow-up of 119 weeks, 2741 (85\%) experienced viral suppression to less than 500 copies/mL by 32 weeks. Relative hazards (RHs) of achieving this were 1.08 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.21) and 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.04) for baseline CD4 cell counts between 200 and 349 x 10(6)/L and baseline CD4 cell counts lower than 200 x 10(6)/L, respectively, compared with baseline CD4 cell counts of 350 x 10(6)/L or higher, after adjustment for several factors including baseline viral load. For baseline viral load, the RHs were 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.07) and 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.58-0.74), for 10 000 to 99 999 and 100 000 copies/mL or greater, respectively, compared with less than 10 000 copies/mL, but the probability of viral load lower than 500 copies/mL at week 32 was similar in all 3 groups. Subsequent rebound above 500 copies/mL was no more likely with a lower baseline CD4 cell count or higher viral load. CONCLUSION: In this study, lower CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads at baseline were not associated with poorer virological outcome of ART. Those with baseline viral loads of greater than 100 000 copies/mL had a slower rate of achieving viral suppression},

METHODS: Analysis of 23 studies reporting epidemiological evidence on the joint relation. Comparison of risk of lung cancer in subjects unexposed to asbestos or smoking, exposed to asbestos only, to smoking only, or to both. Estimation of the relative risk associated with asbestos exposure in non-smokers and of statistics testing for additivity and multiplicativity of risk. RESULTS: Eight of the 23 studies provided insufficient data on the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers to test for possible effects of asbestos. Asbestos exposure was associated with a significantly (p{\textless}0.05) increased risk in non-smokers in six of the remaining studies and with a moderately increased, but not significant, increase in a further six. In two of the three studies that found no increase, asbestos exposure was insufficient to increase risks in smokers. In 30 of 31 data sets analysed, risk in the combined exposure group was greater than predicted by the additive model. There was no overall departure from the multiplicative model, the proportional increase in risk of lung cancer with exposure to asbestos being estimated as 0.90 (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.67 to 1.20) times higher in smokers than non-smokers. For two studies significant (p{\textless}0.05) departures from a multiplicative relation were found in some, but not all, analyses. Reasons are presented why these may not indicate true model discrepancies. CONCLUSIONS: Asbestos exposure multiplies risk of lung cancer by a similar factor in non-smokers and smokers. The extent to which it multiplies risk varies between studies, no doubt depending on the type of asbestos involved, and the nature, extent, and duration of exposure.}

We conducted a randomized trial to address this question. METHODS: From October 1989 through February 1999, 695 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer in International Union against Cancer clinical stage T1b, T1c, or T2 were randomly assigned to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy. We achieved complete follow-up through the year 2000 with blinded evaluation of causes of death. The primary end point was death due to prostate cancer, and the secondary end points were overall mortality, metastasis-free survival, and local progression. RESULTS: During a median of 6.2 years of follow-up, 62 men in the watchful-waiting group and 53 in the radical-prostatectomy group died (P=0.31). Death due to prostate cancer occurred in 31 of 348 of those assigned to watchful waiting (8.9 percent) and in 16 of 347 of those assigned to radical prostatectomy (4.6 percent) (relative hazard, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.91; P=0.02). Death due to other causes occurred in 31 of 348 men in the watchful-waiting group (8.9 percent) and in 37 of 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group (10.6 percent). The men assigned to surgery had a lower relative risk of distant metastases than the men assigned to watchful waiting (relative hazard, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, radical prostatectomy significantly reduced disease-specific mortality, but there was no significant difference between surgery and watchful waiting in terms of overall survival.},

In particular, they show that when misclassification is present, covariate control can sometimes increase net bias, even when the covariate would have been a confounder under perfect classification, and even if the covariate is a determinant of classification. Thus, bias due to misclassification cannot be adequately dealt with by the methods used for control of confounding. The examples presented also show that the "change-in-estimate" criterion for deciding whether to control a covariate can be systematically misleading when misclassification is present. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the degree of misclassification when deciding whether to control a covariate.}

METHODS: 38 studies of HIV-1-infected individuals whose dates of seroconversion could be reliably estimated were included in the analysis. Individual data on 13030 HIV-1-infected individuals from 15 countries were collated, checked, and analysed centrally. We calculated estimates of mortality and AIDS incidence rates and estimated the proportions of individuals surviving and developing AIDS at each year after seroconversion from the numbers of observed deaths or cases of AIDS and the corresponding person-years at risk. Analyses were adjusted for age at seroconversion, time since seroconversion, and other factors as appropriate. FINDINGS: Mortality and AIDS incidence increased strongly with time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion. Median survival varied from 12.5 years (95\% CI 12.1-12.9) for those aged 15-24 years at seroconversion to 7.9 years (7.4-8.5) for those aged 45-54 years at seroconversion, whereas for development of AIDS the corresponding values were 11.0 years (10.7-11.7) and 7.7 years (7.1-8.6). There was no appreciable effect of exposure category on survival. For AIDS incidence, the exposure category effect that we noted was explained by the high incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in those infected through sex between men. We estimated that among people aged 25-29 years at seroconversion 90\% (89-91) and 60\% (57-62) survived to 5 years and 10 years, respectively, after seroconversion, whereas 13\% (12-15) and 46\% (44-49), respectively, developed AIDS (excluding Kaposi's sarcoma). INTERPRETATION: Before widespread use of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (before 1996), time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion were the major determinants of survival and development of AIDS in Europe, North America, and Australia.}

This study was performed in order to determine if European or non-European origin influence provision of health-care and survival among HIV patients in Europe. METHODS: Fifty HIV clinics in 17 European countries are involved in a European prospective, observational multicentre study. In total, 7230 consecutive patients with HIV attending a routine clinic visit were included in the study. Data on demographics, treatment and laboratory results were collected at time of recruitment into the study and thereafter every 6 months. RESULTS: The median CD4+ lymphocyte count at AIDS diagnosis was 60/mm3, and was similar for all ethnic groups (P = 0.87, Kruskall-Wallis test). The median terminal CD4+ lymphocyte count was 17/mm3 and, again, there was no significant difference between continents of origin (P = 0.35, Kruskall-Wallis test). Antiretroviral drugs were initiated at similar median CD4+ lymphocyte counts and there was no statistically significant difference in survival after a diagnosis of AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS was diagnosed at the same level of immunodeficiency independent of European or non-European origin and antiretroviral drugs were provided at similar levels of immunodeficiency. No differences in survival depending on continent of origin was found. In spite of these encouraging findings concerns remain that belonging to an ethnic minority can be an obstacle in getting into contact with treatment facilities and thus benefiting from developments in the management of HIV},

Logistic regression was used to investigate how the probability of a death being missed by NHSCR varied with the year of birth, age at death, sex, and social class. SETTING: Deaths up to the end of 1989 in the CA postal area among 264,046 children born between 1950 and 1989 to mothers living in Cumbria. RESULTS: NHSCR originally ascertained 4139 deaths; local searches confirmed 3338 (81\%) of these and found an additional 342. Most deaths missed by the NHSCR were neonatal deaths in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s, 31\% of children who died in the neonatal period either were not entered on NHSCR or, if they were entered, there was no record of their death. For children born from 1970 onwards, ascertainment of deaths through NHSCR was over 99\% complete. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSCR was started in 1948 for the administration of records of National Health Service patients. It seems that many babies who died soon after birth were not therefore recorded. In parallel with the increasing use of NHSCR for epidemiological purposes, there has been a substantial and continuing improvement in its clerical procedures since the mid 1960's.}

	annote = {Ecological bias is sometimes attributed to confounding by the group variable (ie the variable used to define the ecological groups), or to risk factors associated with the group variable. We show that the group variable need not be a confounder (in the strict epidemiological sense) for ecological bias to occur: effect modification can lead to profound ecological bias, whether or not the group variable or the effect modifier are independent risk factors. Furthermore, an extraneous risk factor need not be associated with the study variable at the individual level in order to produce ecological bias. Thus the conditions for the production of ecological bias by a covariate are much broader than the conditions for the production of individual-level confounding by a covariate. We also show that standardization or ecological control of variables responsible for ecological bias are generally insufficient to remove such bias.}

METHODS: A formal meta-analysis of all nine randomized trials of terazosin using both an Empirical Bayes and a fully Bayesian approach was conducted. A pooled analysis was conducted on those studies in which patients had a baseline assessment of prostate volume by transrectal ultrasonography. RESULTS: No evidence of heterogeneity was found in the estimated effects of terazosin on the change in peak flow rates in the studies. Terazosin treatment was associated with an increase in the peak flow rate of 1.4 mL/s (95\% confidence interval [1.0, 1.7]) compared with placebo. Terazosin resulted in an average reduction of 2.2 points over placebo (95\% confidence interval [1.6, 3.0]) regarding the common symptom score (range 0 to 36 points). A mild heterogeneity was found across the studies, with the decrease in symptom score slightly greater with longer treatment duration. No evidence was found that the baseline prostate volume influenced the effect of terazosin. CONCLUSIONS: Terazosin was effective and superior to placebo in reducing symptoms and increasing the peak urinary flow rate. The effect of terazosin on the peak urinary flow rate was apparent in studies as short as 8 weeks. Most importantly, the effect of terazosin on symptoms and peak urinary flow rate was independent of the baseline prostate size for the range of prostate volumes reported.}

SETTING: Cervical cancer incident cases and deaths in NSW for 1972-96 were obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry, Sydney, Australia. DESIGN: Data were analysed by age-period-cohort (APC) modelling, using Poisson regression. Projection of incidence to 2006 was based on a linear trend for period effects. A counterfactual scenario was constructed assuming stable period effects (1972-74), but modelled cohort effects. Modelled rates were converted to cases and deaths (using mortality:incidence ratios for cervical cancer), and compared with actual data to estimate cancers prevented and deaths averted due to screening. RESULTS: Rising cohort effects with recency of birth were found after controlling for age and period of diagnosis, and declining period effects were identified after controlling for age and birth cohort. The estimated cumulated number of new cases of cervical cancer prevented during 1972-1996 was 3440. The cumulated number of averted deaths over 1972-1996, derived from incident cases, was estimated to be 1610 (including actual declines in the M/I ratio). With no change in the M/I ratio from 1972, estimated cumulated mortality averted due to cervical cancer for 1972-1996 was 1210 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical screening has prevented a substantial number of new cases of cervical cancer and deaths. In addition, secondary prevention and improved treatment has contributed further to cervical cancer deaths averted.}

A sample of males (n = 276), 40 years of age or older, completed a 15-item questionnaire. Patients' self-reports of PSA and DRE screening were then compared with medical records. RESULTS: Results showed that patients' self-reports of DRE and PSA were discordant with the medical record 32 and 29\% of the time, respectively. Sensitivity of patients' self-reports for DRE and PSA was 82 and 74\%, respectively. Specificity of patients' self-reports for DRE and PSA was 56 and 65\%, respectively. One in five patients reported that they were not sure how a doctor checks a man's prostate gland. Only 39\% of patients knew that the prostate gland can be checked by a blood test. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences between patients' self-reports and the medical record. The results should be of concern to primary care practitioners and to those who evaluate the efficacy of prostate cancer screening programs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To project long-term estimates of the number needed to screen (NNS) and the additional number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one prostate cancer death with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in Europe and in the United States.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING

A mathematical model of disease-specific deaths in screened and unscreened men given information on overdiagnosis, disease-specific survival in the absence of screening, screening efficacy, and other-cause mortality is presented. A simulation framework is used to incorporate competing causes of death.


RESULTS

Assuming overdiagnosis and screening efficacy consistent with European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) results, we project that, after 25 years, 262 men need to be screened and nine additional men need to be screen detected to prevent one prostate cancer death. Corresponding estimates of the NNS and the additional NNT under a range of overdiagnosis rates that are consistent with U.S. incidence are 186-220 and 2-5.


CONCLUSIONS

Long-term estimates of the NNS and the additional NNT are an order of magnitude lower than the short-term estimates published with the results of the ERSPC trial and may be consistent with cost-effective PSA screening in the general U.S. population.},

Rats received the genotoxic carcinogen N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM); placental glutathione S-transferase was used as a marker of initiated cells (G + cells). Single G + cells appeared within 24 h after NNM; their frequency increased steeply for similar to 2 weeks, then decreased and finally remained constant. G + foci consisting of greater than or equal to 2 G + cells appeared successively after the single cells. Histological determination of DNA replication and apoptosis revealed that: the formation of single G + cells may not depend on DNA replication of precursor cells; single G + cells showed considerably lower DNA replication than G- normal hepatocytes; from the 2-cell stage onwards GS foci displayed enhanced DNA replication and apoptosis, Data from histological sections were transformed into the third dimension by a new stereological method which considers the non-spherical shape of many G + lesions. Rates of division and death of G + cells and of formation and growth of G + foci were estimated by a stochastic model: initially G + clones appeared at a rate of 12 000 per day and liver until a maximal number of 176 000 (phase I) was reached; thereafter they declined to 134 000 (phase II); they then remained constant (phase III). Estimated division rates of G + cells decreased from phase I to phase III, while the death rate increased in phase II, when every third G + clone disappeared. As a result, at day 50 after NNM only 0.3\% of G + single cells had formed a clone containing greater than or equal to 5 cells. In conclusion, experimental and computed parameters provide direct evidence that hepatocarcinogenesis evolves clonally and that initiated hepatocytes have a selective proliferation advantage, associated with an enhanced potential to undergo apoptosis, Thereby, depending on the conditions, initiated clones expand or become extinct, Extinction may lead to reversion of the biological effects of initiation.}

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five male cases, diagnosed by a panel of pathologists, were personally interviewed concerning their occupational and smoking history. The same number of population controls (matched for sex, age and region of residence) underwent similar interviews by trained interviewers. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for an expert-based exposure index using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Exposure to asbestos shows the expected sharp gradient with an OR of about 45 for a cumulative exposure {\textgreater} 1.5 fiber years (arithmetic mean 16 fiber years). A significant OR was calculated even for the lowest exposure category "{\textgreater} 0 - {\textless} or = 0.15 fiber years". Although the mean cumulative exposure to MMVF is roughly 10\% of the exposure to asbestos, an increased OR is observed in an ever/never evaluation. This observation is heavily hampered by methodical problems. A corresponding case-control study was performed using a lung tissue fiber analysis in addition to interviews. Both interviews and the lung tissue analysis yielded similar OR levels between the reference and the maximum exposure intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a possible influence as a result of selection and information bias, our results confirm the previously reported observation of a distinct dose-response relationship even at levels of cumulative exposure below 1 fiber year. Moreover, the study confirms that asbestos is a relevant confounder for MMVF. A causal relationship between exposure to MMVF and mesothelioma could neither be detected nor excluded, as in other studies.}

The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate evidence for an association between socioeconomic circumstances during childhood and specific CVD subtypes, independent of adult socioeconomic conditions. METHODS: We systematically retrieved individual-level studies of morbidity and mortality from CVD and specific CVD subtypes linked to early life influences, including coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, peripheral vascular disease, markers of atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness and stenosis), and rheumatic heart disease. Indicators of socioeconomic position in childhood varied, although most studies relied on father's occupation. RESULTS: We located 40 studies (24 prospective, 11 case-control, and 5 cross-sectional) reported in 50 publications. Thirty-one studies (19 prospective, 7 case-control, and all 5 cross-sectional) found a robust inverse association between childhood circumstances and CVD risk, although findings sometimes varied among specific outcomes, socioeconomic measures, and sex. Case-control studies reported mixed results. The association was stronger for stroke and, in particular, hemorrhagic stroke, than for CHD. Childhood socioeconomic conditions remained important predictors of CVD, even in younger cohorts. CONCLUSION: Childhood and adulthood socioeconomic circumstances are important determinants of CVD risk. The specific contribution of childhood and adulthood characteristics varies across different CVD subtypes. Disease-specific mechanisms are likely to explain the childhood origins of these adult health inequalities.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening depends on a careful balance of benefits, in terms of reduced prostate cancer mortality, and harms, in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We aimed to estimate the effect on overdiagnosis of restricting prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing by age and baseline PSA.
METHODS: Estimates of the effects of age on overdiagnosis were based on population based incidence data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. To investigate the relationship between PSA and overdiagnosis, we used two separate cohorts subject to PSA testing in clinical trials (n = 1,577 and n = 1,197) and a population-based cohort of Swedish men not subject to PSA-screening followed for 25 years (n = 1,162).
RESULTS: If PSA testing had been restricted to younger men, the number of excess cases associated with the introduction of PSA in the US would have been reduced by 85\%, 68\% and 42\% for age cut-offs of 60, 65 and 70, respectively. The risk that a man with screen-detected cancer at age 60 would not subsequently lead to prostate cancer morbidity or mortality decreased exponentially as PSA approached conventional biopsy thresholds. For PSAs below 1 ng/ml, the risk of a positive biopsy is 65 (95\% CI 18.2, 72.9) times greater than subsequent prostate cancer mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer overdiagnosis has a strong relationship to age and PSA level. Restricting screening in men over 60 to those with PSA above median ({\textgreater}1 ng/ml) and screening men over 70 only in selected circumstances would importantly reduce overdiagnosis and change the ratio of benefits to harms of PSA-screening.},

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a prospective study of women with known dates of HIV seroconversion to describe the incidence and outcome of pregnancy and to assess differences according to age and exposure group. To compare the rate of disease progression between pregnant and nonpregnant women. PATIENTS: All participants, recruited from 14 clinical centers in Italy, had documented HIV-seronegative test results followed by confirmed positive test results within 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 331 women, who had seroconversion between 1981 and 1994, were followed up for a median of 5.5 years from seroconversion; 94 developed HIV-related diseases, 47 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 53 had at least 1 CD4 cell count lower than 0.10 x 10(9)/L ({\textless} 100 cells/mm3). Thirty-eight women (11.5\%) were pregnant at the time of HIV seroconversion and 31 (9.4\%) became pregnant after HIV seroconversion (cumulative incidence of pregnancy within 8 years of seroconversion, 28.9\%; 95\% confidence interval, 21.6\%-36.2\%). Forty-five (65.2\%) of the 69 pregnancies were carried to term. There were no discernible differences in these findings by age or exposure group. Pregnant women did not experience a more rapid rate of progression of disease, even when adjusting for age, exposure group, CD4 cell count, or use of treatment (adjusted relative hazards: HIV-related diseases, 0.72; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 0.69; CD4 cell count {\textless}0.10 x 10(9)/L, 1.24). CONCLUSION: Women infected with HIV continue to become pregnant after seroconversion, yet pregnancy does not appear to influence the rate of progression of HIV disease},

Twelve male fast bowlers (mean age 25 years) from an Australian state cricket squad were observed for the 1999--2000 cricket season. Workload was quantified by examining fixture scorecards and conducting surveillance at training sessions. Injury data were obtained from Cricket Australia's Injury Surveillance System. The seasonal incidence of injury was high with seven bowlers sustaining nine injuries. Whilst injured bowlers did not tend to bowl a greater number of deliveries on the day of injury, a significant increase in deliveries per session was observed in the 8-21 days prior to the date of injury (mean= 77) as compared with the rest of the season (mean= 60, p{\textless} 0.02). Bowlers with a weekly bowling workload above the mean of 203 deliveries were at an increased risk of injury (Risk Ratio (RR)= 6.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-35.91). Those bowlers who bowled in five or more sessions in any 7-day period were also at an increased risk of injury (RR= 4.5, 95\% CI 1.02 to 20.12). A consistent relationship between high bowling workload and injury was observed. The risk of injury was much higher for those bowlers with a sessional, weekly and monthly bowling workload above the group mean, especially when this high workload was consistent and sustained.}

	annote = {BACKGROUND: It was very reasonable to consider that the combination of the 5alpha-reductase, finasteride, and a pure antiandrogen such as flutamide should provide an effective form of maximal androgen blockade (MAB). Finasteride decreases intraprostatic levels of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the antiandrogen would restrain the biological action of the residual DHT by interfering with its association with androgen receptor. This form of MAB should sustain the concentration of testosterone in plasma, thereby maintaining sexual function and reasonable quality of life. In order to investigate this, a randomized multicenter phase II clinical trial of patients with untreated M1 cancer of the prostate was developed and undertaken. METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to one of three treatment schedules: 1) goserelin, 3.6 mg, s.c., monthly in combination with flutamide, 250 mg., t.i.d. and a placebo, daily, in the image of 2 x 5 mg finasteride; 2) goserelin, 3.6 mg., s.c., monthly in combination with finasteride, 10 mg (2 x 5 mg, daily) and a placebo (t.i.d.) in the image of flutamide; and 3) finasteride, 10 mg (2 x 5 mg, daily) in combination with flutamide (250 mg, t.i.d.). The reduction in concentration of serum PSA at 24 weeks was the endpoint of interest. RESULTS: Baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of the patients in the three groups were very similar. There was a substantial decrease in levels of PSA in the three groups prior to the end of the study, the percent decrease in the groups being: 1) goserelin and flutamide combination, 99.1\% (95\% Confidence interval (CI), 97.7, 99.6); 2) goserelin and finasteride combination, 98.75\% (95\% CI, 97.1, 99.5); and 3) finasteride and flutamide combination, 97.6\%, 95\% CI, 94.5, 98.9). In the Generalized linear model (GLM) analysis, there was no center by treatment group interaction (P = 20), and there were no significant differences between centers (P = 0.059) nor among the three treatment groups (P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in levels of PSA in such a group of patients with M1 cancer of the prostate over a 24-week period was surprisingly large, and the differences in these decreased levels between the three treatment arms were remarkably small. There were no apparent differences in bone scan scores, World Health Organization (WHO) performance status, and pain scores between the arms. With regard to sexual function associated with quality of life, there were the understandable difficulties of data collection from patients treated with goserelin.}
